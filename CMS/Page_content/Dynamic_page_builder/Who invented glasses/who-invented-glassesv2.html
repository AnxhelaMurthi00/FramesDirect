<h1>Who Invented Glasses? A Complete History of Eyeglasses and Sunglasses</h1>

<p>
    Eyeglasses were invented in <strong>Northern Italy between the late 1200s and early 1300s</strong>, most likely by
    multiple craftsmen
    rather than a single inventor. While <strong>Salvino D’Armati</strong> is often credited, historians agree that
    eyeglasses evolved
    gradually during the Renaissance period as optical knowledge advanced.
</p>

<h2>When Were Glasses Invented?</h2>

<p>
    Most historians agree that <strong>eyeglasses were invented between 1000 and 1250 AD</strong>, with the first
    wearable spectacles
    appearing in <strong>late 13th-century Italy,</strong> particularly in Pisa and Florence.
</p>

<p>Early eyeglasses consisted of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two <strong>convex lenses</strong></li>
    <li>Riveted together</li>
    <li>Held directly on the nose (no temples)</li>
</ul>

<p>They were primarily used to aid <strong>reading and close work.</strong></p>

<h2>Who Invented Eyeglasses?</h2>

<p>There is <strong>no single confirmed inventor of eyeglasses</strong>. Instead, several historical figures contributed
    to their
    development.</p>

<h3>Salvino D’Armati and Early Italian Spectacles</h3>

<p>
    Salvino D’Armati is traditionally credited with inventing eyeglasses in the late 1200s. However, no definitive
    evidence
    confirms he was the sole inventor. Most scholars believe eyeglasses emerged from collective experimentation in Italy
    during the Renaissance.
</p>

<h3>Roger Bacon and the Science Behind Lenses</h3>

<p>
    In 1266, <strong>Roger Bacon</strong>, an English Franciscan friar, documented how convex lenses could correct
    vision. His work
    helped
    establish the scientific principles of magnification.
</p>

<h3>Alhazen and the Foundations of Optics</h3>

<p>
    Earlier still, <strong>Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)</strong> wrote influential optical treatises around the year 1000.
    His research
    earned
    him the title Father of Modern Optics and laid the groundwork for corrective lenses.

<h2>Did Benjamin Franklin Invent Glasses?</h2>

<p>
    No. <strong>Benjamin Franklin did not invent eyeglasses</strong>, but he did invent <strong>bifocals</strong> in the
    mid-1700s.
</p>

<p>Franklin split lenses into:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Upper portion for distance vision</li>
    <li>Lower portion for near vision</li>
</ul>

<p>This allowed wearers to see clearly at multiple distances without changing glasses.</p>

<h2>Eyeglasses During the Renaissance</h2>

<p>
    Eyeglasses became more widespread during the <strong>Renaissance</strong>, especially after the invention of the
    <strong>printing press in
        1452.</strong>
</p>

<p>Key developments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increased literacy created demand for vision correction</li>
    <li>Florence became a major center of eyeglass production</li>
    <li>Monks and scholars were early adopters</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In 1306, <strong>Giordano da Rivalto</strong> referenced eyeglasses in a sermon, noting they had existed for fewer
    than 20 years at
    the time.
</p>

<h2>When Were Modern Eyeglasses Invented?</h2>

<p>
    Modern eyeglasses—with <strong>temples that rest on the ears</strong>—emerged in the <strong>early 20th
        century</strong>, becoming widespread in the
    1920s.
</p>

<h3>Key Innovations in Modern Eyewear</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Curl-side temples (mid-1800s)</li>
    <li>Custom-ground lenses</li>
    <li>Lightweight metal and acetate frames</li>
    <li>Cylindrical lenses for astigmatism</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Today, the Vision Council estimates that <strong>over half of U.S. adults wear eyeglasses.</strong>
</p>

<h2>The History of Sunglasses</h2>

<p>
    Sunglasses evolved independently from eyeglasses and were not originally designed for sun protection.
</p>

<h3>Who Invented Sunglasses?</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>12th-century China:</strong> Smoky quartz lenses used to conceal facial expressions</li>
    <li><strong>Inuit cultures:</strong> Walrus-ivory goggles with narrow slits to reduce glare</li>
    <li><strong>18th century England:</strong> James Ayscough experimented with tinted lenses</li>
</ul>

<h2>When Did Sunglasses Become Popular?</h2>

<p>
    Sunglasses gained mass popularity in <strong>1929</strong>, when <strong>Sam Foster</strong> introduced affordable
    sunglasses using injection-molding
    technology.
</p>

<p>Later innovations included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>UV protection</li>
    <li>Polarized lenses</li>
    <li>Anti-reflective coatings</li>
    <li>Shatter-resistant materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Invention of Aviator Sunglasses</h2>

<p>
    In the 1930s, <strong>Bausch & Lomb</strong> developed aviator sunglasses for U.S. military pilots.
</p>

<p>Key milestones:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of polarized lenses</li>
    <li>UV protection</li>
    <li>Public popularity during WWII</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This marked a turning point in sunglass technology and fashion.

<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
<p>
    Eyeglasses were not invented overnight. They are the result of <strong>centuries of optical
        experimentation</strong>, cultural needs,
    and technological progress—evolving from simple reading aids into the advanced eyewear we rely on today.
