<p>Navigating the variety of blue light filtering glasses (including computer glasses and gaming glasses) can be difficult. Most makers rely on the same blue light filtering technology. Blue light does not occur as a single wavelength of color but as a range, including blue-violet light and blue-turquoise. Not all glasses filter the same amount of <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/blue-light.htm" target="_blank">blue-violet light</a>, and many don’t filter the lower energy blue-turquoise that is emitted by digital devices.</p>

<p>The best options offer improved blue-violet light filtering. This includes more options and technologies which help further reduce exposure to <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/blue-light.htm" target="_blank">blue-violet light</a>.</p>

<h2>What Is Blue-Violet Light?</h2>
<p>Blue-violet light is short-wavelength light. It scatters more easily than longer-wavelength light like reds and yellows. Digital screens such as those on computers, cell phones, and tablets produce artificial LED blue light.</p>  

<p>Since it scatters more easily, this LED blue light makes focusing harder for your eyes.</p>

<p>These screens also often produce blue-turquoise light, a lower-energy form of blue light. The specific amount of blue-violet and blue-turquoise light emitted by digital devices can differ depending on the manufacturer, device, and setting.</p>

<p>A blue light filtering lens (also often called blue light blocking lens, or simply blue blockers) can improve this discomfort and make focusing at work much easier.</p> 

<h2>How To Choose The Best Blue-Violet Light Filtering Eyewear</h2>
<p>The best blue light glasses filter at least 50% of high-energy, short-wavelength, visible light*. They also cut glare from the screen. A yellow-tinted lens in blue light filtering glasses filters out some high-energy blue-violet light. This can be more effective than a simple clear lens for wearers who spend extended hours in front of a bright electronic device. For people who do not spend hours gaming, reading, or working in front of a screen, the yellow-tinted lenses may not be necessary.</p>
