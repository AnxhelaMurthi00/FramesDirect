<h1>Best Blue Light Filtering Glasses for Kids</h1>

<p>Kids always seem to be on their digital devices, and many displays emit blue light. One thing that many people don’t realize, however, is that computer screens are a very small source of blue light. The majority of blue light exposure comes from sunlight, even inside homes, offices, and schools.</p>

<p>Still, decreasing overall exposure to blue light may improve visual comfort by decreasing glare, especially for kids who spend prolonged periods using digital devices.</p> 

<h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing Children's Blue Light Glasses</h2>

<p>Here are some things to keep in mind if you’re looking for <a href="/knowledge-center/computer-glasses">blue light filtering glasses</a> for kids:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lens quality</strong> – Opt for high-quality lenses that filter out at least 90% of blue light.</li> 
  <li><strong>Frame durability</strong> – Kids can be hard on glasses, so it’s important to get something sturdy. Plastic frames are popular because they’re lightweight, flexible, and durable.</li> 
  <li><strong>Comfort and fit</strong> – A comfortable fit is essential to ensure kids actually wear their glasses consistently. Consider bendable frames or a pair with adjustable nose pads and spring hinges for added comfort and flexibility.</li> 
  <li><strong>Additional lens coatings</strong> – You may want to add other lens coatings in addition to the blue light filter. An anti-scratch coating can help the lenses last longer and an anti-reflective coating helps reduce glare.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>How to Encourage Kids to Wear Blue Light Glasses</h2>

<p>Kids’ glasses won’t help if your child won’t wear them. Try these tips to encourage your child to wear their blue light glasses:</p>

<ul> 
  <li><strong>Let them choose their frame</strong> – Once they pick a few favorites, your eye doctor or optician can help make sure the frames are the right fit and size.</li>
  <li><strong>Take it slow</strong> – Start by having your child wear their glasses for 15 minutes while using a device, then gradually increase that time until wearing their glasses becomes a habit. This should also give their eyes time to adjust.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it cool to wear blue light glasses</strong> – Does your child like Harry Potter, Arthur the Aardvark, or Mirabel from Encanto? Remind them that these and many of their other favorite characters wear glasses.</li>
</ul>
