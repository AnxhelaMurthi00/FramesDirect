<h2>Understanding Contact Lens Types</h2>
<p>
    One of the many benefits of <a href="https://www.framesdirect.com/contact-lenses/">contact lenses</a> is the variety of available types. However, with different materials and wear schedules comes different care instructions.</p>
<p>
Daily disposable lenses are crafted for single-day use, eliminating the need for cleaning or storage. Simply discard them at the end of the day. These lenses are an ideal choice for those with busy lifestyles or anyone seeking a low-maintenance option. 
</p>
<p>
Monthly lenses can be used for up to 30 days. They require nightly cleaning and storage in a disinfecting solution to maintain lens clarity and user comfort.  
</p>
<p>
    Extended wear lenses allow continuous use for a week or up to a month without nightly removal. However, they require careful monitoring and regular cleaning to maintain clarity and comfort. 
</p>
<p>
    Each lens type caters to different lifestyles and needs, but all require proper hygiene to maintain comfort and usability. Understanding these options will assist in selecting lenses that suit your routine and eye care needs. 
</p>
<p>
    Following the doctor-recommended care instructions for your contacts ensures eye comfort and a healthy lens-wearing experience. For further details on cleaning contact lenses, refer to our <a href="https://www.framesdirect.com/knowledge-center/contact-lens-faq">contact lens FAQ</a>.

<h2>Essential Cleaning Supplies</h2>
<p>
Maintaining clean contact lenses is essential for clarity and comfort. Here’s what you will need to clean them effectively: </p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Antibacterial Soap</strong> – Begin by washing your hands with antibacterial soap before handling your lenses. This step minimizes the transfer of bacteria and dirt, reducing potential infection. Use a fragrance- and moisturizer-free soap to avoid leaving residue on the lenses.</li>
    <li><strong>Saline Solution</strong> – Use saline solution for rinsing and storing lenses. It removes debris and keeps lenses moist and comfortable. Saline solution is gentle on the eyes and integral to lens care.</li>
    <li>Astigmatism</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrogen Peroxide Solution</strong> – For a deep clean, utilize a hydrogen peroxide solution to eliminate protein deposits and buildup on lenses. Be advised that hydrogen peroxide must be neutralized before using it on your contacts. Failure to neutralize it can lead to serious eye irritation. </li>
</ul>
<p>
These supplies create a comprehensive cleaning regimen that maintains lens clarity and comfort, contributing to overall user satisfaction. 
</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Cleaning Process</h2>
<p>
While <a href="https://www.framesdirect.com/knowledge-center/how-to-clean-your-glasses">cleaning your glasses</a> can allow a little room for error, cleaning contact lenses requires attention to detail and hygiene. This is because glasses rest on your face, while contacts rest directly on your eyeballs.  </p>
<p>
Properly cleaning your contact lenses is essential to maintain eye health and prevent infections. Follow these steps each time you remove your reusable contact lenses (note: daily disposable lenses should be thrown away after each use and do not require cleaning). </p>
<h3>1. Wash and Dry Your Hands</h3>
<p>
Use soap and water to thoroughly wash your hands, then dry your hands with a lint-free towel. Avoid using oily or lotion-based soaps, as they can leave residue on your lenses. 
</p>
<h3>2. Remove and Handle One Lens at a Time</h3>
<p>
Always start with the same eye when removing, cleaning, or putting in your contacts. Doing so will keep you from mixing up the lenses. </p>
<h3>3. Apply Cleaning Solution</h3>
<p>
Place the lens in the palm of your hand. Apply a few drops of fresh multipurpose contact lens solution. Never use tap water, saliva, or homemade solutions to clean your lenses. </p>
<h3>4. Rub the Lens</h3>
<p>
Gently rub the lens with your fingertip for about 10–20 seconds on each side (follow your solution manufacturer’s instructions for exact timing). This “rub and rinse” method is recommended even for “no-rub” solutions, as it removes deposits and microorganisms more effectively. </p>
<h3>5. Rinse the Lens</h3>
<p>
Rinse both sides of the lens with fresh solution for about 10 seconds per side (or as directed by your solution’s instructions). Never use tap water for rinsing. </p>
<h3>6. Store the Lens </h3>
<p>
Place the cleaned lens in a clean contact lens case. Fill the case with fresh multipurpose solution, ensuring the lens is fully submerged and not folded. Never “top off” old solution with new.  </p>
<h3>7. Repeat for the Other Lens</h3>
<p>
Follow steps 2–6 for your other contact lens. </p>
<h3>8. Soak Lenses </h3>
<p>
Let your lenses soak in the solution for the recommended time (usually overnight or as directed by your solution’s instructions). Doing so disinfects them before the next use. 
</p>

<h2>How to Keep Your Contact Lens Case Clean</h2>
<p>
Cleaning your contact lenses doesn’t do much good if you store them in a dirty lens case. Follow the care tips below to make sure your case, and in turn, your contacts, are clean. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Rinse</strong> – After removing lenses, rinse the case with fresh contact lens solution. Avoid tap water due to potential contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Clean</strong> – Clean the case weekly with mild soap and warm water, then rinse thoroughly with contact lens solution to eliminate residues.</li>
    <li><strong>Air Dry</strong> – Let the case air dry completely on a clean surface to prevent mildew. </li>
    <li><strong>Regular Replacement</strong> – Change your contact lens case every three months to minimize risks. </li>

Consult with an eye doctor for further guidance or recommendations regarding contact lens case care. </p>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid </h2>

    <li><strong>Failing to wash your hands</strong> – It's also common to neglect thorough handwashing before handling lenses. This is essential to prevent debris and microorganisms from causing discomfort or infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixing old and new solution</strong> – Reusing old contact solution or topping it up can dilute its effectiveness, leading to potential buildup issues.</li>
