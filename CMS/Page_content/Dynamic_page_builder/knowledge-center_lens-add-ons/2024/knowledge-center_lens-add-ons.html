<h2>What Add-Ons Can You Get With Glasses?</h2>
<p>From photochromic add-ons to digital light protection, lens coatings and add-ons allow you to fully customize your sunglass or eyeglass lenses. No matter how you want to tailor your lenses, we can help ensure that you receive the perfect pair to suit your needs. The most common add-ons for glasses are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Light Intelligent Lenses<sup>&trade;</sup></li>
<li>Duraclear<sup>&trade;</sup> Premium Anti-Reflective Lens Coating</li>
<li>Blue Light Filtering With Blue Light Lens Coatings</li>
<li>UV Protection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options for Glasses Lenses</h2>
<p>The most common options for glasses lenses are photochromic, anti-reflective, blue light filtering, and UV protective coatings. A photochromic coating reacts with UV light making lenses darken in sunlight, and lighten again in low-light conditions. An anti-reflective coating reduces the mirror-like quality of lenses to help reduce eye strain, while a blue light coating filters blue-violet light emitted by screens. A UV protective coating filters out ultraviolet light and protects your eyes from the sun's harmful rays. Additional coatings that can improve vision and performance include <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/coatings.htm" target="_blank">anti-glare, anti-fog, and scratch-resistant coatings</a>. Anti-glare coatings are a great way to reduce eye strain from screens when applied in addition to a blue light filtering treatment. Anti-fog coatings can help your lenses stay clear in humid, wet, or warm conditions. And scratch-resistant coatings do what the name suggests, and help protect your lenses from normal wear and tear. With <a href="/knowledge-center/how-to-clean-your-glasses">proper cleaning and care</a>, a scratch-resistant coating can also help prolong the life of your lenses.</p>

  <dd id="sect-1" class="accordion-content">
    <p>For lenses that stay clear indoors but offer just the right amount of tint outdoors, add a photochromic treatment. At FramesDirect.com, our photochromic lens technology comes from industry leader <a href="/knowledge-center/transitions-lenses-dp">Transitions Optical</a>. They make Transitions® Signature® and Transitions XTRActive® lens treatments that provide the benefits of sunglasses in your everyday eyewear. These lenses are completely clear indoors but darken in seconds when you step outdoors, eliminating the need for a separate pair of prescription sunglasses.</p>
    <p>Benefits of Transitions Lenses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remain clear indoors and at night, but darken to the ideal tint in daylight</li>
      <li>Always-on protection</li>
      <li>Help protect from UV and filter blue-violet light</li>
      <li>Block 100 percent of UVA and UVB rays</li>
      <li>Perfect options for any prescription and frame</li>
      <li>Suitable for any age, even for children</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Transitions lenses are everyday lenses for everyone. But since they react only to UV light&mdash;and not visible light&mdash;they won’t work in the car.</p> 
    <p>Transitions availability depends on the lens type, material, and package selected. If you have questions about Transitions lenses, please speak to one of our expert opticians at 1-800-248-9427.</p>

  <dd id="sect-2" class="accordion-content">
    <p><a href="/knowledge-center/anti-reflective-coating" title=" Anti-Reflective Lenses Defined">Anti-reflective (AR) or anti-glare treatment</a> coating is a clear coating that reduces reflections on the front and back of your lenses, letting more light through for better clarity. One of the biggest benefits of an applied anti-reflective coating is reduced eye fatigue or eye strain caused by glare. Anti-glare treatment also provides superhydrophobic properties that make your glasses easier to clean. We recommend AR-coated lenses in any pair of glasses.</p>

    <p>Eye care professionals recommend you wear glasses with <a href="/knowledge-center/uv-coating" title="Benefits of UV Coating">UV protective lenses</a> every time you go outside.

    <p>Our clear, UV-protective lens coating blocks 100 percent of harmful UVA and UVB rays to help protect against:</p>
