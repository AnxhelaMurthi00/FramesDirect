<p>Computer glasses have become one of the latest advancements in eyewear to help reduce eye strain from prolonged screen use. Nearly 70% of Americans have experienced the pain of digital eye strain from too much time spent close up to digital displays, and computer glasses are designed to reduce this common issue.</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure to our screens can cause serious eye strain. Help eliminate digital eye strain, or computer vision syndrome as it is commonly called, with a pair of computer glasses.</p>


<h2>What Are Computer Glasses?</h2>
<p>Computer glasses are prescription or non-prescription eyewear with lenses that are designed to filter blue light. Computer eyeglasses look just like any other pair of glasses, but they’re designed specifically for use with computers, TVs. phones, and tablets.</p>

<p>These <a href="/knowledge-center/best-computer-glasses">glasses range from cheap frames you can pick up at a grocery store, to high-tech glasses designed for gamers and programmers</a> who spend more than half their time on screens. Specialized computer glasses, from <a href="/eyeglasses/gunnar">brands like GUNNAR</a>, come with proprietary features, including lightweight, innovative frame materials and lens treatments, but may not be necessary for those who use screens casually, or for only a few hours a day.</p>

<h2>What Are The Best Glasses For Computer Screens?</h2>
<p>The best glasses for computer screens are a pair of well-fitting frames that do not squeeze, pinch, or cause headaches, fitted with lenses that include a blue-light filtering coating. At FramesDirect.com, we refer to this coating as our BlueReflect™ lens technology. <a href="/knowledge-center/measure-your-frame-size">Comfort is paramount in computer glasses</a>, as you will want to wear them all day.</p>

<p>Popular brands including <a href="/eyeglasses/ray-ban">Ray-Ban</a> and <a href="/eyeglasses/oakley">Oakley</a> make streamlined frames that offer superior comfort features for all-day wear. If you're a heavy gamer, or you spend more than 10 hours a day on a screen, it may be time to look into computer glasses with yellow or amber lenses to help filter out the maximum amount of blue light possible.</p>

<h2>How Do Computer Eyeglasses Work?</h2>
<p>Computer eyeglasses work by filtering blue light emitted from digital screens. Computer glasses lenses are typically designed to filter as much as 50% of overall blue light.</p>

<h2>What Is Blue Light?</h2>
<p>Blue-violet light is a high energy light made up of short wavelengths. This visible light, in the violet end of the spectrum, may make it less comfortable to focus on objects or text on your screen.</p>

<p>While blue-violet light occurs naturally and the largest source (even indoors) is the sun, digital screens can emit blue light as well. Computer glasses can help filter some of this blue light.</p>
<p><em>Blue-violet light is between 400 and 455nm as stated by ISO TR20772-2018.
(ISO: International Standards Organization – “Ophthalmic optics – Spectacles lenses – Short Wavelength visible solar radiation and the eye, FD ISO/TR 20772”)</em></p>

<h2>What Are The Symptoms Of Computer Vision Syndrome?</h2>
<p>Computer Vision Syndrome (or CVS for short) has varied symptoms that include eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, dry eyes, and head and neck pain. Computer vision syndrome isn’t just one condition — it is an entire range of eye ailments that affects between 50% and 90% of those who work or play in front of a computer screen for extended periods.</p>

<p>These four problems are commonly associated with computer use, and lead to the symptoms of computer vision syndrome:</p>   
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Optical noise –</strong> Glare creates optical noise, which tires the eyes. This is a problem among people who work on primary light sources, such as computers. Scratches and smudges tend to intensify glare.</li>
      <li><strong>Eye strain –</strong> Sitting at a close distance to a digital screen for long periods can contribute to eye strain and fatigue.</li>
      <li><strong>Dry eyes –</strong> Prolonged, concentrated viewing of computer screens typically results in less blinking, which leads to dry, irritated eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Heavy eyeglasses – </strong> <a href="/knowledge-center/adjusting-to-new-glasses">Wearing eyeglasses for extended periods can result in uncomfortable pressure</a> and pain at their points of contact.</li>
    </ol>




    <h2>How Can I Avoid Computer Vision Syndrome?</h2>
 
    <p>You can avoid computer vision syndrome by wearing a pair of computer eyeglasses. Even if you don't normally wear glasses, you can wear non-prescription computer glasses that can help alleviate the symptoms of computer vision syndrome. You can also get computer glasses in your prescription and continue to enjoy optical clarity while protecting your eyes.</p>
