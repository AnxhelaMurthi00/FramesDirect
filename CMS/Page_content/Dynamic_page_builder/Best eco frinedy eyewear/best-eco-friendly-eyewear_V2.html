<h2>The Best Sunglasses and Eyeglasses Made From Recycled Materials</h2>
<p>Costa and Zeal are among the best recycled eyewear brands available, each offering environmentally conscious
    materials in a wide array of eyewear styles. But which sunglass and eyeglass frames are truly the most bio-based? We
    dove into all of the options available to bring you the Recycled Eyewear of the Year.</p>

<p>The Recycled Eyewear of the Year:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#costaSpearo">Best Recycled Eyewear Brand: Costa Spearo</a></li>
    <li><a href="#zealIncline">Best Recycled Sunglasses: Zeal Optics Incline</a></li>

    <li><a href="#costaBaffin">Best Recycled Eyewear Brand: Costa Buffin-Untangled Collection</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="costaSpearo">Recycled Eyewear Brand: Costa Spearo</h2>
<p>Most recycled eyewear offers a single environmental benefit. But Costa has gone above and beyond to create the <a
        href="/costa-ocearch-spearo-sunglasses">OCEARCH Spearo</a>, with frames crafted in the company’s proprietary
    bio-resin, and a portion of the proceeds from every pair going to shark research. Not only do the OCEARCH Spearos
    help the environment in multiple ways, but they’re also built to perform with Premium Polarized 580 Lenses and a
    rectangular shape that nods to the wayfarer design, with added versatility. Between its Earth-saving properties and
    performance features, the OCEARCH Spearo easily topped our list as the Best Recycled Eyewear of the Year.</p>

<h2 id="zealIncline">Best Recycled Sunglasses: Zeal Optics Incline</h2>
<p>Zeal designs some of the best outdoor sports eyewear available, so it follows that they’d work hard to create
    sunglasses that help protect the very outdoor spaces where they draw inspiration. The maker uses proprietary Z-Resin
    (a plant-based polymer derived from castor beans) to create its action <a
        href="/zeal-optics-incline-sunglasses">sports-inspired Incline frames</a>, keeping plastic out of landfills and
    wild places. The Incline takes top honors as the Best Recycled Sunglasses on our list. Whether you’re ultrarunning
    across 10,000-foot passes or grilling in the backyard, you can count on the performance design of the Incline and
    feel good about the sustainable materials used in its construction. If you want the Best Recycled Sunglasses, look
    no further than the Zeal Optics Incline.</p>

<h2 id="costaBaffin">Best Recycled Eyewear Brand: Costa Buffin-Untangled Collection</h2>
<p>Costa not only designs some of the <a href="/knowledge-center/best-fishing-eyewear">best fishing sunglasses in the
        world</a> but the <a href="/costa-baffin-untangled-collection-sunglasses">Costa Baffin – Untangled
        Collection</a> takes top honors on our list as the Best Recycled Eyewear for its versatile design and use of
    recycled fishing nets in the construction of the eyewear. In removing fishing net pollution from the oceans, Costa
    found a way to turn the nets’ nylon into a lightweight and durable sunglass frame material. The maker uses Hydrolite
    nose pads and temples in the Baffin Untangled Collection for a secure fit, and Premium Polarized 580 Lenses for
    crystal-clear vision. These frames feature a versatile rectangular shape in a pair of recycled material sunglasses
    that look great and hold up during the most grueling adventures.</p>
