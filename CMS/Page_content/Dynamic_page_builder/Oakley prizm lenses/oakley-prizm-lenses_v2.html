<h1>What are Oakley Prizm Lenses?</h1>
<p>Oakley Prizm lenses are performance sunglass lenses designed specifically for sports like baseball, fishing, golf,
    skiing, and biking. Dark lenses alone can make it harder to see, so instead of only filtering UV rays, Oakley's
    Prizm lenses boost certain wavelengths of color vision for improved contrast and detail. The result is fine-tuned
    vision and richer color.</p>

<p class="mt-3">Oakley has been at the <a href="/sunglasses/oakley-replacement-lenses">forefront of innovative eyewear
        design</a> since 1984. Not happy with the available options for sports-specific sunglasses, Oakley set out on a
    15-year research and development project to create the groundbreaking Prizm lens. Using hyperspectral imaging,
    Oakley examined spectral peaks in every possible light and weather condition, across the terrains we love to tackle.
    Snow, ice, water, dirt, and pavement&#151;no surface was ignored. After examining the data collected by the
    hyperspectral cameras, Oakley’s team got down to business creating Prizm lenses tailored to specific situations,
    including fishing, cycling, baseball, and golf&#151;and the result beats our wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Oakley Prizm sunglasses are built not only to perform in demanding environments but to improve your vision in any
    light condition. While you could use the same pair of sunglasses across the board, these sunglasses give you the
    opportunity to boost your performance with better vision. Pick out the minute details and make split-second
    decisions no matter the sport. Create the <a href="/knowledge-center/the-best-oakley-sunglasses">perfect pair of
        sunglasses</a> by adding on the features that matter most to you: <a
        href="/collections/best-polarized-sunglasses-dp">polarized lenses</a>, <a
        href="/collections/mirrored-sunglasses-dp">mirror coatings</a>, and a prescription.</a>

<h2>Prizm lenses are different from your everyday contrast, or tinted, sunglasses lenses</h2>
<p>In addition to <a href="/knowledge-center/uv-coating">shading your eyes from the sun and blocking UV rays</a>,
    Oakley’s Prizms target individual wavelengths of color and refine them. They enhance the world around you to provide
    better visual acuity&#151;filtering out the bad light that washes out or hinders vision, and amping up the good
    light to improve contrast and decrease eye fatigue. Light transmission percentages based on common
    conditions&#151;overcast, sunny, or extra-bright light&#151;help provide even better vision. Better yet, <a
        href="/knowledge-center/the-best-oakley-sunglasses">some Oakley models allow you to switch up your shades with
        interchangeable Prizm lenses</a> ultra-specialized for different conditions.</p>

        <p>Prizm lenses and polarized lenses are two different technologies that are sometimes combined into one lens or
            sometimes offered independently. For example, some Oakley Prizm lenses, like Prizm Field Lenses, are <a
                href="/collections/best-polarized-sunglasses-dp">polarized to block glare from reflected light</a>, but
            this doesn't apply to every pair of Prizm lenses. So, Prizm lenses don't mean polarized&mdash;it's an
            entirely different lens technology. Whereas polarized lenses block glare from reflected light, Prizm lenses
            amplify what you're seeing. That being said, most polarized and all Prizm lenses offer 100% UV protection
            from the sun's rays, keeping your eyes safe from strain and burn while out of doors.</p>

                like FramesDirect.com</a>. Next, if you have frames designed for easy lens swapping like the Flak 2.0,
            simply pinch the nose piece and pull the old lenses away to remove, and then pinch the nose piece again and
            press the new lenses in to lock the new lenses into place. For more traditional frames, use your thumbs to
            gently push the old lens from the back to the front, until the lens pops out. Be careful not to damage the
            frame in this process. Once your old lenses are removed, line up the new lenses, one at a time, and gently
            press them into place with your thumbs from back to front. They should snap into place. If you have
