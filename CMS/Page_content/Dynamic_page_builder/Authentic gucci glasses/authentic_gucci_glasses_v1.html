<h2>How To Tell if Gucci Sunglasses Are Real</h2>
<p>Identifying Gucci sunglasses vs. real Gucci sunglasses can be challenging. You can spot the variations between the
    real and fake sunglasses with small details in and outside of the box they came in.</p>

<h3 class="color-green weight-bold size-18">Features of Authentic Gucci Sunglasses: A Checklist</h3>
<p>When you’re confirming the legitimacy of your designer frames, you’ll want to look for the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Packaging –</strong> Gucci glasses come in a lavish box with the Gucci logo on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Sunglasses case –</strong> A case sits inside the retail box. The Gucci logo should be written on the
        front of the case and the stitching on the case’s fabric should be spaced evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Dust cloth –</strong> Your pair of sunglasses comes with a dust cloth with the Gucci logo printed in the
        center.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate of authenticity –</strong> New sunglasses also include a small certificate of authenticity,
        which is kept in an envelope. Check for a consistent pattern on the envelope and for even spacing in the text.
        The reverse side of the certificate provides details about the color and style of your glasses. Make sure they
        match your frames.</li>
    <li><strong>Manufacturer’s sticker –</strong> On the packaging, you’ll find a sticker that includes a bar code and
        the name of the manufacturer of your glasses. Gucci only uses one manufacturer called Safilo Group. This should
        be the name you see on every genuine sticker.</li>
    <li><strong>Frame engraving (right arm) –</strong> Inside the right arm of your glasses, you’ll find the Gucci logo.
        Next to the logo, you’ll see the words “MADE IN ITALY” and the letters “CE,” which refers to the European
        Conformity.</li>
    <li><strong>Frame engraving (left arm) –</strong> A model number for your frames is printed on the inside of the
        left arm. It also includes a color code and measurements for the lenses and frames. These codes should match the
        ones given on the retail box and/or certificate of authenticity. <i>Note: Gucci glasses use these specific codes
            in place of a serial number</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How To Tell if Gucci Glasses Are Real</h2>
<p>Eyeglasses come with both a <a href="/knowledge-center/eyeglass-lens-guide">personal prescription</a> and proof of
    product authenticity. You’re less likely to run into fake <a href="/eyeglasses/gucci">Gucci eyeglasses</a> than you
    are sunglasses, since they are somewhat custom-made with your prescription.</p>

<p>If you’re buying eyeglasses at your doctor’s office, be sure to examine the frames and check for the engraved logo
    and the details on the arms of the glasses.</p>

<p>Shopping online can feel trickier, so it’s important to find a statement of authenticity somewhere on a given
    website. For example, FramesDirect.com is an authorized retailer of Gucci eyewear. In the product details section of
    a pair of glasses, you’ll find an official statement that the website sells only genuine Gucci frames.</p>

<h2>Check the Price Tag</h2>

<p>How much are Gucci glasses? Most frames range from about $300 to $700, but they can be more or less depending on the
    design and features.</p>

<p>If a price is suspiciously low, you may want to investigate. Prices should be in the same range among all verified
    retailers. If you’re unsure about a pair, compare it with those at another website or store.</p>

<p>It’s not unusual for people to sell their pre-owned glasses through reselling apps and websites. You may even find
    some at an estate sale or at a discount department store. In these cases, the cost of Gucci glasses is often lower.
</p>

<p>If you buy from one of these merchants, double check for proof of authenticity. It can be limiting since these
    products are not brand new, so make sure to check off as much as you can in the features checklist provided above.
</p>

<h2>Try Using Gucci Tag for Authentication</h2>

<p>If you have trouble determining whether or not your Gucci glasses are genuine, there are some special tools that can
    help.</p>

<p>Gucci’s website provides a tool called Gucci Tag that allows users to scan a photo of an item and receive information
    about it in return.</p>

<p>In addition to receiving authentication of your product, you can also learn how your glasses were made and the best
    ways to care for them. You can also get personal assistance from Gucci client advisors if you have any lingering
    questions.</p>

<p>Whether it’s Gucci or another designer brand, it’s important to confirm that you are getting what you pay for. Don’t
    be afraid to research and ask questions if you’re unsure about the authenticity of something. Merchants take pride
    in being verified Gucci sellers, just as you likely take pride in being a Gucci enthusiast.</p>
