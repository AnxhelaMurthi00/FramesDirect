<p>There comes a time for every glasses wearer to experience loosened frames, whether it’s due to normal wear and tear,
    improper handling, or other events in life. As frustrating as it can be, there’s often an easy fix to keep glasses
    from slipping.</p>

<p>If you find your glasses sliding down your nose constantly, you may need to make some adjustments. The following are
    some reasons your glasses won’t stay put and what you can do about it.</p>

<h2>Why Are My Glasses Sliding Down My Face?</h2>
<p>Some of the most common reasons glasses slip include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Your frames are too loose –</strong> Screws and other hardware can get loose over time.</li>
    <li><strong>The temples are bent out of shape –</strong> Sometimes the temples (arms of the frames) bend out of
        alignment due to wear or mishandling.</li>
    <li><strong>Your glasses are made of heavy materials –</strong> Extra weight can drag your frames down.</li>
    <li><strong>The frames are too wide for your face –</strong> Loose, ill-fitting glasses are likely to shift out of
        place.</li>
    <li><strong>The bridge of your nose doesn’t align with the frames –</strong> Your nose pads could need tightening,
        or you may need a frame that is more suitable for your features.</li>
    <li><strong>Your glasses or skin are oily –</strong> Oil builds up on your skin as you exercise, cook, or use
        oil-based cleansers or makeup. This can transfer to your frames and make things slippery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How To Keep Glasses From Sliding Down Your Nose</h2>
<p>Now that you know why your glasses keep sliding down your nose, solving the problem may be easier. Whether your
    frames are too wide, too heavy, or too loose, there’s usually a fairly simple fix.</p>
<p>Consider these 10 tips to prevent glasses from slipping:</p>

<h3>1. Tighten Your Frames</h3>
<p>Screws come loose over time due to normal wear and tear. If this is the case for your slipping glasses, use a glasses
    repair kit to <a href="/knowledge-center/how-to-tighten-glasses">tighten the screws</a> located where the temples
    fold to meet your lenses.</p>

<p>If you have trouble, contact your optometrist for a professional adjustment.</p>


<h3>2. Adjust Your Nose Pads (or Add Some to Your Frames!)</h3>
<p>It’s easy for nose pads to move around, especially if you wear glasses every day. To put them back in place, simply
    press the pads inward until they fit snugly on your face.</p>

<p>Some glasses don’t come with nose pads. If you think your frames could benefit from the support, try placing adhesive
    pads on the bridge of your glasses.</p>

<h3>3. Use Wax Coating</h3>
<p>Wax may be the last thing you would’ve considered to keep glasses from slipping, but many people find it quite handy.
    Beeswax and other eyeglass wax products can help create friction between your nose and nose pads. Just place a small
    amount on the nose pads and go.</p>

<p>Be sure to clean your glasses (and your face) afterwards, though. Leftover wax can get greasy and make the issue of
    slipping glasses much worse.</p>

<h3>4. Adjust Bent Temples</h3>
<p>Another normal sign of wear and tear? Bent temples. When the sides of your glasses bend or loosen, you may find
    yourself trying to hold them up behind your ears. Fortunately, you can bend the temples back in place.</p>

<p>Metal frames are easier to mold than plastic ones. All you need to do for a metal frame is carefully and gently push
    and pull the temples to a fit that works for you. Plastic temples are more complicated, and may be better handled by
    your optometrist.</p>

<p>If you have any troubles or fears bending your temples yourself, don’t hesitate to seek professional help. You may
    risk breaking your frames altogether if you try to alter them at home.</p>

<h3>5. Try an Eyewear Band</h3>
<p>An eyewear band is a strap that attaches to the ends of your glasses’ temples. It keeps your glasses balanced from
    front to back so that they don’t slip or fall down. The band can also raise your glasses up a bit higher, depending
    on how tight you make it.</p>

<h3>6. Tie Rubber Bands Around the Temples</h3>
<p>If you’ve got two rubber bands or hair ties lying around your home or office, use them to your advantage to help with
    slipping glasses! Just wrap a loop around the ends of both temples several times — enough to create a small cluster.
</p>

<p>Place your frames back on and move the clusters forward or backward on the temples until you feel secure.</p>

<h3>7. Keep Your Frames Clean</h3>
<p>Dirty frames can interfere with the way they fit. Your skin can get oily throughout the day, and this can transfer
    grease to your glasses, causing them to slip and slide on your face. Other things like cooking and exercise can also
    introduce grease and sweat to your frames.</p>

<p><a href="/knowledge-center/how-to-clean-your-glasses">Keeping your frames clean</a>, and washing them after an
    oil-inducing activity, will help to keep them in place.</p>

<h3>8. Use Oil-Free Cosmetics and Cleansers</h3>
<p>Since oil transfers easily, it’s important to keep your face and skin as oil-free as possible. Try using foundations
    and other cosmetic products, as well as facial cleansers and moisturizers that don’t have oil in them. This can help
    prevent unwanted grease that encourages slippery frames.</p>

<p>This method may not be for everyone, though, as some people have sensitive skin and can only tolerate certain
    products.</p>

<h3>9. Install Ear Grips</h3>
<p>Many retailers sell grips or “ear hooks” that slide onto the ends of your temples. This is a quick and easy way to
    prevent glasses from slipping, and the grips can be adjusted to fit any pair of glasses.</p>

<p>However, some people complain that grips cause pinching against the side of the head and that ear hooks are too
    visible for personal preference.</p>

<h3>10. Explore Different Frame Styles</h3>
<p>If you have a wider set nose than others, or a nose that sits lower on your face, you may have trouble keeping your
    glasses in place. And no matter how many remedies you’ve tried, standard-fit glasses just don’t seem to agree with
    your facial characteristics.</p>

<p>Low-bridge glasses could be the answer to your problem. These frames are designed to fit wider on your forehead to
    prevent pinching in your temples, and they have a slight angle that lines up with a lower set nose.</p>

<h2>Is It Time for New Frames?</h2>
<p>If all else fails, you might want to look for a new pair of glasses. And it’s perfectly okay to do so if your frames
    are too wide or too heavy, if they’ve run their course, or if they’re just too uncomfortable to continue wearing.
