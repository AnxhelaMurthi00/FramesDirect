<h2>The Importance of Contact Lens Expiration</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.framesdirect.com/contact-lenses/">Contact lenses</a> allow millions to see without glasses. They come with expiration dates that are essential for ensuring their continued safety and usability. These dates are set based on the materials used and the conditions in which lenses are manufactured and kept. 
<p>
Lens materials can degrade, potentially altering the lensesâ€™ shape and comfort. Expired lenses can support bacterial growth, increasing the risk of infections like conjunctivitis. Additionally, their reduced capacity to allow oxygen to reach the eyes can lead to discomfort. 
</p>
<p>
Following the expiration dates is key to maintaining lens safety. Awareness of the risks linked to expired lenses allows users to make informed decisions about lens care. 
</p>
<h2>How Contact Lenses Expire</h2>
<p>
Contact lenses have a shelf life influenced by packaging and storage methods. 
They are sealed with a sterile saline solution to keep them clean and moist. 
However, packaging can deteriorate over time, potentially letting contaminants in. 
The lens materials themselves can also break down, affecting comfort and safety. 
</p>
<p>
    Proper storage is vital to prolonging lens use. Store lenses in a cool, dry environment away from sunlight to avoid damaging both the packaging and lenses. Temperature changes can cause saline to evaporate or become contaminated, and exposure to air can dry out lenses, making them less comfortable and less safe. 
</p>

    By following storage guidelines and being mindful of expiration dates, users can ensure their <a href="https://www.framesdirect.com/knowledge-center/contact-lens-prescriptions">prescription contact lenses</a> remain effective. Understanding these factors helps care for lenses and supports eye well-being.
