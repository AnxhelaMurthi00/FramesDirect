<h2>Understanding Contact Lenses</h2>
<p>
With the variety of options available, choosing contact lenses can be both exciting and overwhelming. Disposable lenses are particularly popular because they are easy to use and help maintain good hygiene. This type of contact lens is designed for short-term use — often replaced daily or bi-weekly.
</p>
<p>
Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, though less common, offer unique advantages. Made from durable materials, they provide sharper vision, especially for those with specific needs like astigmatism. These lenses also allow more oxygen to reach the eyes, which can enhance comfort throughout the day. 
</p>
<p>
Selecting the right contact lens is crucial for comfort and clear vision. Your lifestyle, budget, and specific vision requirements should guide your decision. Consulting with an eye care professional can help you make the best choice based on your needs and preferences. Understanding these differences enables you to make informed decisions for a more enjoyable contact lens experience.
