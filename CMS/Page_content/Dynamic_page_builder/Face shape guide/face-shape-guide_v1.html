<h1>What are the best glasses for my face shape?</h1>
<p>To find the best glasses for your face shape you need to first identify your face shape and find glasses with a shape
    that will complement your features. With a little knowledge, you’ll be able to find glasses that always enhance your
    look and never detract from it.</p>

<h2>The Round Face</h2>
<p>The round face has a wide forehead, full cheeks, and a rounded chin. It's easily identifiable from its circular
    appearance and the absence of strong lines and angles. When choosing glasses for your round face, aim for square and
    <a href="/shop-by-shape/rectangle-eyewear-dp">rectangular styles</a> that add contrast to your face's natural
    curves, and avoid frames that exaggerate the roundness of it. By adding contrast, you'll make your round face appear
    thinner and longer. Glasses with strong angles and lines will add definition to your face and downplay the fullness
    in your cheeks. Look for <a href="/shop-by-color/animal-print-glasses-dp">vibrant prints</a>, patterns, <a
        href="/shop-by-color">colors</a>, and statement-making embellishments that add contrast; a clear or thin bridge
    will make your eyes appear wider.</p>

<h3>The Best Glasses Frames for Round Faces</h3>
<p>The best glasses for round faces include rectangular and square styles, like <a
        href="/shop-by-shape/wayfarer-eyewear-dp">wayfarer shapes</a>, that offset the soft curves of your features. Opt
    for the <a href="/collections/ray-ban-wayfarer-dp">Ray-Ban Wayfarer</a> and enjoy a stand-out style that will even
    out your face and draw attention to your eyes. The bold square frame style is ultra-flattering, hence its position
    as a mainstay of fashion-forward wearers with round faces for decades. Choose a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses
    or <a href="/eyeglasses/ray-ban">Ray-Ban Wayfarer eyeglasses</a> and make your features pop.</p>


<h2>The Square Face</h2>
<p>The glasses wearer with a square face has a strong jawline and angular features and should choose thinner frames with
    lots of curves for contrast. When you choose frames with characteristics opposite those of your face shape, for
    example round and <a href="/shop-by-shape/cat-eye-eyewear-dp">cat-eye glasses</a>, you won't exaggerate an
    already-angular look. Opt for a glasses style with rims wider than they are tall, in a neutral color&mdash;<a
        href="/shop-by-color">beige, cream, or taupe</a>&mdash;to make your face appear slimmer and softer.</p>

<h3>The Best Glasses Frames for Square Faces</h3>
<p>Cat-eye glasses eyeglasses are far and away the best glasses shape for square faces. This shape feature softly
    rounded edges and a pronounced browline for a silhouette to balance your features without overwhelming them. With a
    retro shape and modern details, cat-eye frames are timeless and will always work for wearers with square faces.</p>


<h2>The Oval Face</h2>
<p>Many consider an oval face the ideal shape because its proportions are balanced, with a narrow forehead, high
    cheekbones, and a narrow chin. While almost any pair of glasses look good on an oval face, select frames as wide as
    or slightly wider than the broadest part of the face. Glasses with detailed embellishments also look great with the
    high cheekbones typical of an oval face. Choose a retro <a href="/shop-by-shape/cat-eye-eyewear-dp">cat-eye</a>, a
    square, or a <a href="/shop-by-shape/round-eyewear-dp">round frame</a> with on-trend details; or opt for the classic
    and <a href="/collections/womens-rectangle-eyewear-dp">versatile rectangular silhouette</a>to flaunt a
    sophisticated, professional look. Your proportions are already even, so consider carefully when choosing <a
        href="/collections/oversized-eyeglasses-dp">oversized frames</a>.</p>

<h3>The Best Glasses Frames for Oval Faces</h3>
<p>With subtle curves complementing an elongated face shape, round frames are the best glasses shape for people with
    oval faces. Consider a narrower frame to balance the look of round glasses on a similarly curved face.</p>



<h2>The Heart-Shaped Face</h2>
<p>The two most distinguishing features of a heart-shaped face are high cheekbones and a jawline that tapers to a
    defined chin. Your face resembles a heart in the sense that its widest part is at the top and its narrowest at the
    bottom (like an inverted triangle). Look for frames that minimize the top of your face and make your chin look
    wider&mdash;choosing a style wider than your forehead will help achieve both. And decorative accents at the
    endpoints of the frame (think <a href="/shop-by-shape/cat-eye-eyewear-dp">cat-eye silhouettes</a> or <a
        href="/ray-ban-rb5154-clubmaster-eyeglasses">Ray-Ban's Clubmaster</a>) will help draw the eye away from the
    forehead. Frames in light colors or with detailing, like a tortoise or floral pattern, will help soften your
    features. The heart-shaped face is versatile, so many glasses styles will suit you.</p>

<h3>The Best Glasses Frames for Heart-Shaped Faces</h3>
<p>Oversized square frames that stretch wider than the forehead and come in light colors are the best glasses for
    heart-shaped faces. Without a doubt, big, square frames will always work with this unique face shape, and are easy
    to find with all of the biggest eyewear designers offering their own creations in this shape.</p>


<h2>The Oblong Face</h2>
<p>An oblong face is long and slender, and may have high cheekbones, a long nose, and a tall forehead. Choosing frames
    with tall rims will help create balanced proportions on an oblong face. Also, broad rims with color-accented tops or
    decorative temples will help add width to your oblong face.</p>

<h3>The Best Glasses Frames for Oblong Faces</h3>
<p>A tall, <a href="/shop-by-shape/square-eyewear-dp">square frame shape</a> with rounded bottom rims is the best choice
    for oblong faces. This shape blends sharp angles and subtle curves to highlight long, slender faces and enhance
    features. If you have a tall forehead and a slim face, tall-square frames should be your go-to shape.</p>

<h2>The Diamond-Shaped Face</h2>
<p>Characterized by broad, distinctive cheekbones, parallel narrow eye lines, and narrow jawlines, the diamond face
    shape is the rarest of all. Somewhat similar to the heart-shaped face shape because of its full cheeks, the
    diamond-shaped face is actually a silhouette all its own. Once you've identified this shape as yours, focus on
    eyeglasses with angular, edgy elements to complement the angular features of your face. This will soften the
    cheekbones and draw attention directly to your eyes. <a href="/shop-by-shape/square-eyewear-dp"
        title="Rectangular Frames">Wider frames</a> will balance your look and lend a dramatic, stylish touch to your
    features. Avoid <a href="/knowledge-center/how-should-glasses-sit-on-your-face"
        title="How Glasses Should Sit on Your Face">narrow eyeglass frames</a>, as they will further emphasize your
    narrow eye line.</p>

<h3>The Best Glasses Frames for Diamond-Shaped Faces</h3>
<p>Wide, <a href="/shop-by-frame-type/semi-rimless-frames-dp">semi-rimless</a>, square or rectangular frames, like the
    Cubmaster style, are the best frame shapes to complement the narrow eye line and full cheeks of wearers with
    diamond-shaped faces. If Clubmasters don’t suit your personal style, consider rectangular or cat-eye shapes.</p>
