    <li>We also share personal information with selected third parties for their own marketing purposes (except for your
        mobile information or biometric information). This also includes information collected through pixels and other
        tracking technologies operated by third parties, as described elsewhere in this Policy. See the "Your Choices"

        America Inc., or any of our respective affiliates, service providers, customers, or (iv) as Luxottica of America

            href="/customer-service/terms-of-use" target="_top">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
    <li>We may also share your information with your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or
        sharing.</li>
    <li>As with any business, it is possible that as ours develops, we might go through a business transition, such as a
        merger, acquisition by another company, or the sale of all or a portion of our assets, or buying online stores
        or other assets, including at bankruptcy. In such transactions, information about customers will likely be
        transferred.</li>
    <li>The Platforms may allow you to provide comments in various sections of our Platforms, such as in product

<h4>Advertising Industry Resources</h4>

<p>You can understand which entities have currently enabled Cookies for your browser or mobile device and how to opt out
    of some of those Cookies by accessing the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1"
        target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative's website</a> or the <a
        href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance's website</a>. For
    more information on mobile-specific opt-out choices, visit the <a
        href="https://www.thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative's Mobile
        Choices website</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised.
    Therefore, you will need to opt-out on every browser and device that you use.</p>

<h2 id="pp-advertising" class="transform-uppercase">5. Digital Advertising &amp; Analytics / Interest-Based Ads</h2>

<p>We may partner with ad networks and other ad-serving providers ("Advertising Providers") that serve ads on behalf of
    us and others on the platforms and non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that
    they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the
    Platforms and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and
    devices ("Interest-based Advertising").</p>

<p>You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some Advertising Providers
    may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral
    Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit <a
        href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, and <a
        href="https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank">https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices</a> for
    information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps.</p>

<p>Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the
    NAI and the opt-out options for their members, see <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1"
        target="_blank">https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1</a>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to
    opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you continue to receive other types of ads.</p>

<p>Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you
    but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also,
    if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase
    your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app),
    your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. We support the ad industry's 2009
    Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a
        href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf"
        target="_blank">https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>) and expect that
    ad networks we directly engage to serve you Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though we cannot
    guarantee their compliance. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties'
    opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>

<p>Advertising Providers may use data collected in connection with our advertising campaigns for the following purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>For measurement and insight reporting (to produce and provide us with reports measuring the impact and
        performance of our advertising campaigns).</li>
    <li>To produce benchmarking reports to share with their other customers, but such benchmarking reports will not
        identify you.</li>
    <li>To target our ad campaigns to specific groups of individuals having particular characteristics.</li>
    <li>To improve and optimize advertising services (for example, to support the objectives of our ad campaigns,
        improve the effectiveness of their own advertising services and determine the relevance of ads to individuals).
    </li>
    <li>To personalize ads that the Advertising Providers show, including enhancing user profiles with inferred
        interests.</li>
    <li>For their internal purposes, including (i) to promote and ensure the safety and security of any of their
        products and services; (ii) to detect and prevent malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, invalid, or illegal
        activity; (iii) for research and development purposes; and (iv) to maintain the integrity of and to improve
        their products and services.</li>
    <li>To combine it with other data collected by Advertising Providers in order to provide greater insights in respect
        of our advertisements.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also work with service providers that collect data about your use of the Sites and other sites or apps over
    time for non-advertising purposes subject to their privacy policies. We use analytics providers such as Google
    Analytics to gather and analyze aggregated anonymous user information. For more information about Google Analytics,

<p>We use web analytics tools to enhance the user experience by optimizing the efficiency, design, and quality of the
    Platforms. Our analytics tools use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information related to
    user behavioral metrics on the Platforms, such as mouse movements, clicks, user inputs, scrolling, access time,
    visit duration, pages viewed, IP address (including approximate location), operating system, and page reloading.
    These tools provide insight into what works and what doesn’t work for users of the Platforms and they allow us to,
    for example, identify and repair technical errors such as broken links that impair the Platforms’ functionality. The
    web analytics tools also help us reconstruct the user experience to better understand, for example, where users may
    be encountering frustration or impediments to using the Platforms.</p>

<p>We use a website analytics tool that provides session replay, heatmaps, funnels, form analytics, feedback campaigns,
    and similar features/functionality. This session replay software may record your clicks, mouse movements, scrolling,
    form fills (keystrokes) in non-excluded fields, pages visited and content, time on site, browser, operating system,
    device type (desktop/tablet/phone), screen resolution, visitor type (first time/returning), anonymized IP address,
    location (city/country), language, and similar metadata. This software does not collect information on pages where
    it is not installed, nor does it track or collect information outside your web browser.</p>

<p>We use this web-based analytics software because it gives us a tool to track the online behavior of visitors while on
    the Platforms and lets us replay visitors' actions. This tool gives us the opportunity to make the Platforms better
    and, in turn, provide you with an enhanced online experience as well. Thanks to this tool, we are able to gain
    insight into how you and other visitors use the Platforms; for example, whether you can easily locate the "Find a
    Store" page or whether it takes multiple clicks to get to that page. Information about these small choices and
    interactions is of paramount value to us, as they can easily make your experience better and more intuitive and,
    more importantly, allow us to provide you with a more seamless, customer-friendly e-shopping experience while on the
    Platforms.</p>

<p>For more information on this session replay software, see Contentsquare's Privacy Policy at <a
        href="https://contentsquare.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://contentsquare.com/privacy-policy/</a>.
</p>

<p>We may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to, among other things, track the actions of users
    of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics
    about usage of the services and response rates. Our Advertising Providers may use pixel tags to collect information
    for the purposes described above.</p>

<h2 id="pp-third-party" class="transform-uppercase">6. Third-Party Links &amp; Plug-In</h2>

<p>The Platforms may provide links to third-party websites or apps, including our social media pages. We do not control
    the privacy practices of those websites or apps, and they are not covered by this Policy. You should review the
    privacy policies of other websites or apps that you use to learn about their data practices.</p>

<p>The Platforms may also include integrated social media tools or "plug-ins," such as social networking tools offered
    by third parties. If you use these tools to share information or you otherwise interact with social media features
    on the Platforms, those social media companies may collect information about you and may use and share such
    information in accordance with their own policies, including by sharing such information with us or the general
    public. Your interactions with third-party social media companies and the use of their features are governed by the
    privacy policies of the companies that provide those features. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for any
    social media accounts you create and use.</p>

<h2 id="pp-biometric" class="transform-uppercase">7. Biometric Information We Collect</h2>

<p>Through various technology features, including but not limited to our virtual technology features and/or when you
    upload a photo through one of our Platforms, we may collect data that potentially falls under the definitions of
    "biometric identifiers" or "biometric information" under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS §
    14/1 et seq. and Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act ("CUBI"), Bus. & Com. § 503.001 et seq. "Biometric
    identifiers" are defined as retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, or scans of the hand or face geometry.
    "Biometric information," means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared,
    based on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual.</p>

<p>Any collection of biometric identifiers and biometric information is for the sole purpose of assisting you in viewing
    how certain eyeglasses may look on your facial features. We will not disclose or disseminate any biometric
    information to any entity, other than those contracted parties that assist us in providing this service to you, or
    as required by applicable federal, state, or local law, or required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued
    by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>We will not share your biometric identifiers and biometric information with any entity except in the following cases:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information with contacted parties that assist us in
        providing services to you via our Platforms.</li>
    <li>We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information where it is required by applicable federal,
        provincial, or local law.</li>
    <li>We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information where it is required pursuant to a valid
        warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<p>We shall retain any biometric identifiers or biometric information for the limited period of time required to provide
    you with the service, and shall not exceed six months as long as you consent to such retention, maintain an account
    with us, and expressly request to save your virtual profile to your account. If you do not maintain an account with
    us, we shall retain biometric identifiers or biometric information for up to six months, but we will not be able to
    retrieve or connect your information to your identity. After six months, all biometric identifiers or biometric
    information we have collected from you shall no longer be retrievable or readable by our operating systems or
    applications.</p>

<p>We use appropriate technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to store, transmit, and protect from the
    disclosure of any biometric identifiers or biometric information collected. Such storage, transmission, and
    protection from disclosure shall be performed in a manner that is the same or more protective than the manner in
    which we store, transmit, and protect from the disclosure of other confidential and sensitive information.</p>

<p>Biometric information will only be collected by us with your prior explicit consent. Before using our virtual
    technology features, you will be prompted with a copy of this policy. By clicking "I accept" you are consenting to
    our collection and storage of your biometric identifiers or biometric information.</p>

</ul>

<p>We use cookies and other tracking technologies to display advertisements about our products to you on nonaffiliated
    websites, applications, and online services. This is "targeted advertising" under applicable privacy laws. When we
    engage in those activities, we sell personal data (i.e., information from cookies) to third-party advertisers and
    analytics companies. We do not use personal data for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or
    similarly significant effects concerning individuals.</p>

<p>To exercise your rights, please submit a request through our interactive web form available <a
        href="https://privacy.luxottica.com" target="_blank">here</a> or by emailing us at <a

    the identity of the individual on whose behalf you are making such request. To do so, we will ask you to verify data
    points based on information we have in our records. If you are submitting a request on behalf of another individual,

        three cookie options in the cookie manager tool</a>.</p>

<p>If you enter into a Loyalty Program with us, we will collect your name, email address, and you may choose to provide
    us with your birth date and gender. We do not provide your personal data to data brokers. If you ask us to delete
    your personal data, we will not be able to provide you with the benefits of our Loyalty Program because we will
    delete your account.</p>

<h3>Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms</h3>

<p>The Sites recognize the Global Privacy Control ("GPC") signal. If you are using a browser setting or plug-in that
    sends an opt-out preference signal to each website you visit, we will treat that as a valid request to opt-out. To
    download and use a browser supporting the GPC browser signal, click here: <a
        href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs" target="_blank">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs</a>. If you
    choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.
    See the "<strong class="transform-uppercase">Do Not Track Signals</strong>" section below for information on our
    treatment of do not track signals.</p>

<h2 id="pp-nevada" class="transform-uppercase">9. Notice to Nevada Residents</h2>

<p>Nevada law allows Nevada residents to opt out of the sale of certain types of personal information. Subject to
    several exceptions, Nevada law defines "sale" to mean the exchange of certain types of personal information for
    monetary consideration to another person. We currently do not sell personal information as defined in Nevada law.
    However, if you are a Nevada resident, you still may submit a verified request to opt out of sales, and will record
    your instructions and incorporate them in the future if our policy changes. You may send opt-out requests through
    our interactive web form available <a href="https://privacy.luxottica.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pp-virginia" class="transform-uppercase">10. Notice to Virginia Residents</h2>

<p>The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act ("VCDPA") provides Virginia residents with the right to receive certain
    disclosures regarding the personal data we process about them. For purposes of this section, personal data means any
    information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data
    does not include de-identified or publicly available information as the VCDPA defines those terms.</p>

    nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of your personal data; (3) delete personal data you
    have provided or we have obtained about you; (4) obtain a copy of your personal data that you previously provided to
    us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data

<h2 id="pp-california" class="transform-uppercase">11. Notice to California Residents</h2>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CCPA"),
    requires that we provide California residents with a privacy policy that contains a comprehensive description of our
    online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, sale, sharing, and retention of personal
    information and of the rights of California residents regarding their personal information. This section of the
    Policy is intended solely for and is applicable only to California residents. If you are not a California resident,
    this section does not apply to you and you should not rely on it.</p>

<p>The CCPA defines "personal information" to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably
    capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular

    aggregated information or lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern. For purposes
    of this "<span class="transform-uppercase">Notice to California Residents</span>" section we will refer to this
    information as "Personal Information."</p>

<p>If you are a California resident and a current or former employee, job applicant, or independent contractor of ours,
    please see our privacy notice available on our job applicant website(s) for more information on our collection and
    use of your Personal Information in that capacity.</p>

<h3>Our Process for Verifying a Request to Know, Delete, and/or Correct</h3>

<p>We will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of
    the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request.</p>

<p>We will verify your identity either to a "reasonable degree of certainty" or a "reasonably high degree of certainty"

<h3 id="pp-financial-incentive">Notice of Financial Incentive</h3>

<p>Frames Direct offers programs, benefits, and other offerings related to the collection, retention, use, or sale of
    your Personal Information that may be deemed a "financial incentive" or "price or service difference" under the
    California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). We are providing you with this information so that you may make an
    informed decision on whether to participate in our program(s). Participation is always optional! Categories of
    Personal Information that we may collect when you sign up for a program include your name and email address. By
    signing up for any of our programs, you affirmatively opt-in to receiving the financial incentive. You can end
    program participation at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com"

<p>Financial incentives or price or service differences relate to the collection and use of Personal Information and are
    based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business,
    taking into consideration the value of the offer or benefit itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may
    be realized by rewarding brand loyalty. We calculate the value of the offer and financial incentive by using the
    expense related to the offer. Based on this analysis, the value of your Personal Information that allows us to make
    these offers and financial incentives is the value of the offer itself.</p>
