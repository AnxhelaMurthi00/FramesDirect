            <p>SINGLE PD, or binocular pupillary distance is the standard measurement of the distance from the center of
                one pupil to the other. Distance PD can be used to order any type of prescription glasses except reading
                glasses.</p>
            <p>DUAL PD, or monocular pupillary distance, is the distance from the center of one pupil to the center of
                the bridge of your nose. Dual PD has two numbers showing the right eye (OD) and the left eye (OS)

            <p>To obtain your PD measurement, simply ask your eye doctor to include it in your prescription.
            <p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the following methods to measure it yourself. Super easy!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the <a href="/knowledge-center/discover-the-opthy-app">Opthy App</a>: Start using OPTHY With
                    just a few clicks, OPTHY measures your Pupillary Distance so you get the perfect fit.</li>
                <li>By yourself: Most optometrists will measure your pupillary distance (PD) during an exam, but some
                    may omit the information from your prescription. Don't worry, there are a few ways to measure your
                    PD on your own, including using your bathroom mirror and a ruler.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avoid an additional appointment with the eye doctor using these steps to ascertain your pupillary
                distance. Just remember that the measurements will need to be in millimeters, so find a ruler with the
                appropriate markings.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand exactly 8" from your mirror.</li>
                <li>Hold a ruler against your forehead.</li>
                <li>Close your right eye and match the 0-millimeter line with your left pupil.</li>
                <li>Open your right eye and close your left eye.</li>
                <li>Find the millimeter marking that lines up with your right pupil.</li>
                <li>The measurement from the center of your left pupil to the middle of your right pupil is your
                    pupillary distance.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>* If you don't feel confident doing this process on your own, grab a friend or family member. They simply
                need to hold the ruler in place and start at step three. From there, they can take the measurement for
                you.</p>
            <p>To measure your PD if you already wear glasses:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Put your glasses on.</li>
                <li>Focus on something about 20 feet away.</li>
                <li>Use a non-permanent marker to put a dot on your right lens where you see the object.</li>
                <li>Repeat step three on your left lens.</li>
                <li>The dots should overlap and look like a single dot when you look at the object with both eyes.</li>
                <li>Take off your glasses and measure the distance between the two dots. This is your pupillary
                    distance.</li>

                <li>A soft toothbrush can be used to wash away any grime around the nose pads. Be careful not to
                    accidently scuff the lens.</li>
                <li>Avoid using rough materials such as facial tissue or paper towels to dry your glasses, as they may
