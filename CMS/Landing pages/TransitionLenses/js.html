      <div>Do <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> Lenses Block UV Rays?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
      <p>Yes, all <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lenses block 100% of UVA and UVB rays.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt class="accordion-title accordion-answer">
      <div>Do <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> Lenses Filter Blue-Violet Light?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
      <p>Yes, all <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lenses filter blue-violet light. The degree of protection against
        blue-violet light when compared to a basic clear lens depends on the <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lens
        you choose and where you are.</p>
      <p><em>Blue-violet light is between 400 and 455nm as stated by ISO TR20772-2018.
          (ISO: International Standards Organization – "Ophthalmic optics – Spectacles lenses – Short Wavelength visible
          solar radiation and the eye, FD ISO/TR 20772")</em></p>

      <div>Can I Wear <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> Lenses for Driving?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
      <p>Yes, but it depends on the kind of <em>Transitions</em> lenses you wear. <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em>
        lenses darken because of exposure to UV rays and since the windshield of your car is designed to block UV rays,
        most <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lenses won’t adequately darken when you’re in a car.</p>
      <p><em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> XTRActive<sup>&reg;</sup></em> new generation lenses are the only
        <em>Transitions</em> lenses designed to darken when exposed to both UV rays and natural (visible, clear, or
        white) light so they will work even when you’re in a car.</p>

        technologies to emerge in eyeglasses.</p>

      <div>Do I Need Anti-Glare Coating With <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em>?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
      <p><em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lenses are offered with two types of glare-blocking options, and while
        neither is needed by everyone, both are preferred by most wearers. Anti-glare, polarized
        <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lenses are preferred by people who spend time outdoors and/or commuting and
        need protection from harsh glare caused by reflective surfaces. The anti-reflection coating available with
        <em>Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup></em> lenses is preferred by both those who spend time outdoors, and those who
        work in an office setting, where vision can be disturbed by reflections caused by lighting, screens, and indoor
        reflective surfaces.</p>
