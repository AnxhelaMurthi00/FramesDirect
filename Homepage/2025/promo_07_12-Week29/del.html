<h1>Transitions&reg; Lenses</h1>

<p>If you're looking for more functionality than an ordinary lens can offer, Transitions lenses are right for you. All
    Transitions lenses continuously adapt to changing light conditions outdoors to help reduce eye fatigue and strain.
    Anyone who wears glasses or sunglasses (prescription or not) can wear Transitions photochromic adaptive lenses.
    Different color lens tints and other options are available to complement every lifestyle, age, and a number of
    different sports and activities. </p>

<h2 class="divider-header">Transitions Lenses: What Are They & How Do They Work?</h2>

<p>The Transitions line of everyday adaptive lenses includes Transitions&reg; Signature&trade;, Transitions&reg;
    XTRActive&trade;, and Transitions&reg; Vantage&trade;. All Transitions lenses offer the latest and most advanced
    adaptive technology and set the standard for performance, visual quality, visual comfort, and eye protection.</p>

<p>Transitions&reg; Drivewear&trade; sun lenses uniquely combine two of the most advanced technologies found in the
    eyeglass industry today: Transitions photochromic technology and NuPolar&reg; polarization. Transitions Drivewear
    sun lenses are optimized for sunlight response and should not be used for night driving.</p>

<p>All Transitions lenses block 100 percent of harmful UVA and UVB rays, helping to protect the health and wellness of
    your eyes.</p>

        Transitions&reg; Signature&reg; are the #1 recommended adaptive lenses worldwide and are the ideal everyday
        choice for enhanced vision. Indoors and at night, the lenses are fully clear. Outdoors, these lenses
        continuously adapt and darken with every variation of light so you can consistently see your best. Transitions
        lenses enhance your vision by providing more clarity and better contrast as well as reducing glare, eye fatigue,
        and strain for more effortless vision.

        Transitions&reg; XTRActive&reg; lenses are the darkest everyday adaptive lens, maintaining a comfortable hint of
        tint indoors (and even behind the windshield of a car) and reaching superior darkness outdoors in changing light
        conditions. These lenses are ideal for prescription lens wearers who are sensitive to light and spend a great
        deal of their time outdoors.

        Transitions&reg; Vantage&trade; lenses are the first and only eyeglass lenses to both darken and polarize upon
        UV exposure. They start out virtually clear and non-polarized indoors. But outdoors, they both adapt to changing
        light and also increase polarization as they darken so that your outdoor vision is noticeably crisper with
        enhanced contrast and sharpness. With Transitions Vantage, glass and water appear more transparent and glare is
        reduced, even in the brightest sunlight.

        Transitions&reg; Drivewear&reg; lenses are polarized adaptive lenses for your driving needs. They block blinding
        glare in all types of daylight, outdoors and in the car. They adapt to the ideal color and darkness according to
        daylight conditions, even behind the windshield.
