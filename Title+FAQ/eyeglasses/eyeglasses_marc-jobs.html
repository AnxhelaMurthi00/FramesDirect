<h2>Marc Jacobs Eyeglasses for Men and Women</h2>

<p>Infuse every day with luxury wearing Marc Jacobs eyeglasses. This designer's frames for men and women showcase an
    edgy sophistication in glasses suited for work days and weekends. A pair of aviator-style glasses in plastic frames
    instead of the more conventional metal is an unexpected twist on a classic frames style, while blending a round
    shape with a cat-eye results in a distinctive hybrid glasses frame.</p>

        <div>How Can You Tell if Marc Jacobs Glasses Are Real?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>Purchase real Marc Jacobs frames from an <a href="/knowledge-center/our-value-proposition">authorized
                retailer like FramesDirect.com</a> to ensure that they are 100% authentic. If you already own a pair of
            Marc Jacobs glasses and want to know whether they’re the genuine article, start by surveying the frames from
            the top of the bridge downwards. The glasses should be completely symmetrical, and without irregularities or
            blemishes. Next, check the interior of the temples. One temple should have the brand name and CE symbol
            stamped on its interior, and the other should have the sizing and style number. Next, check the logos and
            labels on the temples and lenses. If you cannot easily remove them with a fingernail, your glasses are most
            likely real.</p>
