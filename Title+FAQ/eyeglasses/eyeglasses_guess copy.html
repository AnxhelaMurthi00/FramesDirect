<h3>GUESS Eyeglasses Frame Styles</h3>
<p>Lightweight but sturdy performance plastic prevails in the GUESS eyeglasses collection, and it's no wonder: This
    lustrous material lends itself to the wide array of vibrant colors and patterns you’ll find here. Sleek metal frames
    from GUESS look professional without being overbearing or stuffy. Each frame from GUESS offers a bit of unexpected
    detail&mdash;an accent at the temples or a slightly upswept shape reminiscent of a cat-eye or horn-rim frame adds
    some playfulness to a polished appearance. Reach for a sophisticated take on a throwback style in eyeglasses that
    boast modern imaginings of classic favorites. These glasses show off the refined style of the vintage pieces that
    inspired them, but still allow contemporary shapes and materials to shine. Your glasses need not blend in: Chic,
    thick-rimmed styles hint at bookish proclivities while maintaining a fashionable edge. They're classy and elegant
    but flaunt your personality.</p>

        <div>How Can I Tell if My GUESS Glasses Are Real?</div>

    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>If you ordered your GUESS glasses from an authorized retailer like FramesDirect.com, then you can be sure
            they’re 100% real. If you already own a pair of GUESS frames and want to verify their authenticity, then
            follow the first rule from celebrated eyewear designer Luxottica: Look at the frames from the top down to
            ensure they’re perfectly symmetrical—knockoff glasses will often show an irregular construction. Next, check
            for consistent GUESS logos on the exterior and interior of the temples, rims, and lenses. If any of the
            markings or logos on the frames or lenses can be scratched or rubbed off with a gentle touch, that’s a good
            sign the frames are fakes.</p>
