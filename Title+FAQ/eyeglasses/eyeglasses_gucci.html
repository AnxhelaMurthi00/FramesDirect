        <div>How Can I Tell Whether My Gucci Glasses Are Real?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>The best way to tell if the Gucci eyeglasses you’re buying are real is to purchase them from an authorized
            retailer like FramesDirect.com. If you already own a pair of Gucci glasses, look inside the temple for a
            stamp that reads "Made in Italy." If there isn’t a stamp or if they’re stamped with another country of
            origin, they are not authentic Gucci eyeglasses.

        <p>FramesDirect.com sells only authentic Gucci eyeglasses, guaranteed.</p>
