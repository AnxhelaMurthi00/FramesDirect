<h2>Burberry Glasses for Men and Women</h2>
<p>Our Burberry eyeglasses collection showcases the same knack for a distinctive design that earned the British luxury
    brand a global name in fashion. A British sensibility is at the heart of this eyewear that includes current designs
    and modern style elements alongside classic frame silhouettes. The iconic Burberry check pattern emerged in the
    1920s and figures prominently throughout these styles, offering a recognizable motif that's as much a hallmark of
    quality as it is of impeccable taste.</p>



<h2>Burberry Eyeglasses Frames Styles</h2>
<p>Our Burberry eyewear collection includes classic silhouettes and frames that lean decidedly modern. Sleek glasses in
    metal full-rim and semi-rimless styles show off Burberry's passion for innovation—constantly ahead of the <a

    distinguished look that suits <a href="/knowledge-center/glasses-match-outfit"

    takes on retro styles, featuring <a href="/shop-by-color" title="Shop Frames by Color">bold colors and on-trend
        patterns</a>. But the brand hasn't forgotten its deep roots, as seen in the familiar Burberry check, here
    represented in subtle stripes around the rims, there as a tasteful element at the temple. A history of more than 150
    years catering to sophisticated tastes shows in classic frames that exude a timeless appearance.</p>

    fashion with tradition culminates in this noteworthy eyewear collection.</p>
