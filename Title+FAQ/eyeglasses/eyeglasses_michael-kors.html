    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>The best way to make sure that your Michael Kors Glasses are 100% authentic is to purchase them from an
            authorized retailer like FramesDirect.com. If you already own a pair of Michael Kors eyeglasses but have
            questions about their authenticity, first survey your new glasses from the top of the bridge down. If any of
            the components looks warped or is sized incorrectly, there is a good chance the frames are fake. If they
            look perfectly symmetrical, and none of the labels or logos can be easily removed with a fingernail, then
            check the interior of the temples. Authentic Michael Kors glasses will have the style number preceded by a
            clearly printed MK on the inside arm of the glasses.</p>
