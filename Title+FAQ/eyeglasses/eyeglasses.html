        <p>Eyeglasses should fit not too snug and not too loose (think of Goldilocks), and they should be comfortable

    </dt>
    <dd id="sect-02" class="accordion-content">
        <p>The easiest way to find the ideal eyeglass measurements for your face is to start with a pair of eyeglass
            frames that already fit you well. These can be a pair you own or glasses you have tried on in a store.
            Eyeglass measurements are printed on most frames, so if you've found a pair you love, check the inside of
            the frame and write down the numbers you find there. If your frame doesn't include measurements, you can
            measure the frame using a ruler or soft tape measure. Frame measurements are in millimeters, so make sure
            your measuring tool has millimeter increments. The measurements you’ll need to record are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Frame Width:</strong> Measure the horizontal width of the front of the glasses frame from widest
                point to widest point (usually across the brow).</li>

            <li><strong>Lens Height:</strong> Measure the vertical height of the lens from top to bottom at its highest
                point (usually in the middle of the lens).</li>
            <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> The bridge is the part of the frame that goes across your nose. Measure from
                each edge of the bridge piece where it connects to the left and right portions of the rims.</li>
            <li><strong>Temple Arms:</strong> Measure from where the temple arms end behind your ear to where they touch
                the front of the frame (near the hinges if your glasses have them). Depending on the temple design, you
                may need to measure from the hinge to the point where the temple begins to curve behind the ear, and
                then from that point to the temple tip, and then add the two to obtain the correct total measurement.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lens Width:</strong> Measure the horizontal diameter of the lens at its widest part (usually
                across the middle).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The cost of eyeglasses depends on the brand, frame materials, lens quality, and any lens add-ons you want to
            include. Eyeglass prices generally start around $40 for a single vision pair of eyeglasses with basic lenses
            and no add-ons, and go up to as much as $1400 for high-end Chopard designer eyeglasses with a progressive
            no-line prescription, Transitions® lenses, and premium add-ons. On average, you can expect to pay around
            $150 for lower-end designer eyeglasses and around $400 for higher-end designer eyeglasses.</p>

        <p>The best way to clean your eyeglasses is with a soft, non-scratching microfiber cloth. Most eyeglasses and
            sunglasses come with a recommended cleaning cloth, but if you lose yours, it’s easy and inexpensive to
            replace. The microfiber cloth will clean most smudges, film, dust, and other grime. To clean your lenses,
            gently wipe both sides of each one in a circular motion with the microfiber cloth, making sure to get the
            edges of the lens near the frame. If something more stubborn is stuck to your lenses, like a sticky beverage
            or food (it happens), dampen your microfiber cloth with clean tap water and use the same circular motion to
            wipe both sides of the lens clean. Consult our <a href="/knowledge-center/how-to-clean-your-glasses"
