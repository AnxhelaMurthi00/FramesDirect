        <div>How Do I Tell if My Vera Bradley Glasses Are Real?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>To ensure your Vera Bradley glasses are real, always purchase them from an authorized retailer like
            FramesDirect.com. If you own or recently purchased Vera Bradley glasses and want to verify their
            authenticity, we recommend that you first survey them from the top of the bridge downwards. If you can see
            any sizing irregularities or defects, then the frames are most likely fakes. Next, check the interior of the
            temples for sizing and other quality assurance information relevant to the glasses. If none of the labels
            can be gently removed with a fingernail, your Vera Bradley glasses are most likely authentic. And most
            authentic Vera Bradley glasses include an eyeglasses case in a pattern that matches the frames.</p>
