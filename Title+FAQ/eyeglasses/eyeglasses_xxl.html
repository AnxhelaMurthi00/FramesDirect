<h2>XXL Men's Eyeglasses Collection</h2>

<p>XXL crafts men's eyeglasses in lightweight, hypoallergenic titanium and other performance materials, in styles that
    elevate any look. With contemporary silhouettes, retro-inspired details, refined lines, and athletic-minded designs,
    the eyeglasses in this collection are aimed at the man who needs a larger fit but still wants fashionable frames.
    Since 2002, XXL Eyewear has been creating extra-large frames that offer all-day comfort and style that truly
    fits&mdash;both your personality and your face.</p>

<h3>XXL Glasses Materials and Styles</h3>
<p>Find full-rim and semi-rimless XXL eyeglasses in materials engineered to endure your lifestyle: lightweight, durable
    titanium; sturdy performance plastic; and flexible, yet strong metals. Quality craftsmanship and attention to detail
    are priorities in each pair of XXL glasses. Some styles in this collection include a magnetic clip-on sun lens
    attachment for convenience and comfort indoors and out. When frames for average or small facial features won't cut
    it, the stylish options from XXL Eyewear will make the same bold statement or offer a sophisticated, minimalist
    appearance&mdash;in measurements proportioned for an ample head size.</p>

<h3>XXL: Glasses That Fit</h3>
<p>The frames in the XXL glasses collection come in men's sizes between 55 and 63mm, with a wider bridge&mdash;the
    distance between the lenses&mdash;to prevent slipping and pinching. The wider rims allow your eyes to be positioned
    correctly in the lenses, for improved optical clarity. The longer temple arms provide a better fit on a larger head
    and prevent discomfort behind the ears. And because XXL Eyewear approaches design with a focus on comfort, these
    frames are easy to wear all day, every day.</p>
