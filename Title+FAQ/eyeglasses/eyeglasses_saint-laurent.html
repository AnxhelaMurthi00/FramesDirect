        <div>How Can You Tell if YSL Glasses Are Fake?</div>
    </dt>
    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>If you have purchased your YSL glasses from an authorized retailer like FramesDirect.com, then you can be
            100% certain they’re real. If you already own a pair of Yves St Laurent frames and you think they may be
            fakes, first inspect the interiors of the temples. If you find a model number and a 'CE' symbol for European
            Conformity, then your YSL glasses are most likely real. But if you notice misshapen or uneven frames when
            you inspect them from the top down, they may be fakes.</p>
