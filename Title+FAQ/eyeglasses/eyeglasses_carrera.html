    brand a loyal following among athletes and fashionistas. A proud claim by the maker: Carrera fans live by their own
    rules&#151;and Carrera makes eyeglasses that defy short-lived trends to stand out in bold style.</p>
<h3>Carrera Eyeglass Frames Styles</h3>
<p>Confidence and personality shine in each eyeglass frame style by Carrera. Many frames in this collection nod to retro
    styling, but modern techniques and style cues come together to yield appealing eyeglasses for a polished wardrobe.

    treatment. Bolder frames styles in the Carrera collection showcase racing-inspired design elements, including
    swift-looking stripes and colorblocked designs. Thick-rimmed frames and semi-rimless styles are plentiful in classic
    black; more adventurous styles come in dramatic blue, red, or in cool, transparent hues. Kids can show off their
