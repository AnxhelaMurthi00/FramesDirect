    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>Yes, many styles are. While Ray-Ban offers classic looks for men and women, many of their most beloved
            styles, including the <a href="/ray-ban-rb2140-original-wayfarer-sunglasses">Wayfarer</a>, are unisex.</p>

    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>As an authorized retailer of Ray-Ban eyewear, FramesDirect sells only guaranteed authentic Ray-Ban frames. If
            you already have a pair of Ray-Ban glasses and you’re <a
                href="/knowledge-center/where-are-ray-ban-made">worried they may be fakes</a>, first, survey them from
            the top of the bridge downward. If you notice any sizing irregularities or blemishes, the glasses are most
            likely fake. Next, look at the logos and their placement on the frames. If any of the markings or plaques
            can be easily removed with a fingernail, then the frames are most likely not real. Last, check the interiors
            of the temples. The Ray-Ban model number (RB followed by a 4-digit number), color code, lens size, temple
            length, and either 2N or 3N (P if they’re polarized) will all be printed on the inside of the temples. You
            should also see the Ray-Ban logo, where the frames were manufactured, and the CE symbol for European
            Conformity inside the arm of the frames. If you find all of these details, you most likely own a pair of
            authentic Ray-Ban frames.</p>

        <p>Yes, Ray-Ban makes prescription eyeglasses. Rx-ready eyewear from Ray-Ban includes the classic Aviator,
            Wayfarer, and Clubmaster, along with updated styles that riff on the originals, and fresh eyeglasses designs
            featuring contemporary influences. Edgy, modern iterations of these popular styles complement an offbeat
            fashion sense. Dramatic cat-eye frames and bold geometric silhouettes satisfy fashion whims, while round
            wire-rimmed glasses and sophisticated semi-rimless styles speak to more refined tastes.</p>
