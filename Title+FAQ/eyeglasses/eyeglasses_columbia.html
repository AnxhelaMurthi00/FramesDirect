<h2>Columbia Prescription Eyeglasses</h2>
In 1938, two German nationals fled the Nazi’s and settled in the Portland area. They bought a small hat company and
named it Columbia, after the largest river in the Pacific Northwest. These were the humble beginnings of Columbia
Sportswear, now a leading manufacturer of outdoor clothing and accessories.
<br></br>
Columbia has been in the outdoor gear business for over 70 years, and is passionate about providing quality and value to
their adventure-loving customers. Now Columbia has created a line of eyeglasses perfect for enjoying the outdoors –
whether it’s a neighborhood park or a mountain top.
</br></br>
Columbia glasses are designed for both performance and style and made from durable materials like Acetate and Monel, a
metal alloy.
