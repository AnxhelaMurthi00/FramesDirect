<h2>Oakley Eyeglasses for Men and Women</h2>
<p>Oakley, a leading name in sports eyewear and equipment, also offers optical frames so you can enjoy the same quality
    in your eyeglasses as you do in your go-to shades&mdash;the innovative technologies that catapulted this label to
    the top among makers of performance eyewear set this collection apart. Rugged <a
        href="/knowledge-center/oakley-prescription-lenses" title="Oakley Prescription Lenses">prescription Oakley
        eyeglasses</a> for men and women are ideal for an active lifestyle, but they're not out of place at the office
    or during your downtime.</p>

<h3>Oakley Eyeglasses Frame Materials and Technologies</h3>
<p>Oakley eyeglasses frames offer clean lines with an athletic edge, but without an exclusively sports-driven design.
    They're plenty sturdy&mdash;these eyeglasses are constructed with Oakley’s lightweight but durable proprietary
    materials, including C-5 alloy, flexible O Matter® designed to absorb impact, or rugged titanium or resilient carbon
    fiber. Innovative Unobtainium material over the temple tips on some Oakley glasses styles gets even grippier when
    you sweat, helping to keep your glasses in place throughout active days.</p>

<p>A dedication to uncompromising quality means Oakley eyeglasses must pass numerous performance and quality tests. The
    maker’s goal is to create eyeglasses tough enough to withstand even your most extreme adventures. This leading
    performance eyewear brand is renowned for its innovative lens technologies and tight-gripping, no-slip frame
    designs. The Oakley optical collection boasts the same level of quality in daily-wear eyeglasses, and refuses to
    dial back on performance. Explore full-rim, semi-rimless, and rimless styles that suit your fashion sense, and enjoy
    safer, more comfortable eyewear in any setting wearing Oakley glasses.</p>

<h3>Oakley Alternate Fit Prescription Glasses</h3>

<p>Higher cheekbones and a wider nose bridge once meant compromising on style, comfort, and performance in sporty
    eyewear. But Alternate Fit proportions in Oakley eyeglasses allow the wearer with these features to find properly
    fitted frames they love. All Oakley Alternate Fit eyeglasses are crafted in O Matter, the maker’s patented material
    that is lightweight, versatile, durable, and impact resistant.</p>

        <p>If you have purchased your Oakley glasses from an authorized retailer like FramesDirect.com, you can count on
            your frames being 100% authentic. If you already own a pair of Oakleys but <a
                href="/knowledge-center/are-my-oakleys-fake">you’re not sure if they’re real</a>, first look at them
            from above, starting at the browline, and make sure they’re perfectly symmetrical: Fake Oakley glasses often
            show irregularities in their size and shape. Next, check the interior of the temples for a four-digit number
            preceded by OO, along with sizing details and the model name. If you can easily peel or scratch off any of
            the logos on the frame, temples, or lenses, then most likely the glasses you purchased are not authentic
            Oakleys.</p>
