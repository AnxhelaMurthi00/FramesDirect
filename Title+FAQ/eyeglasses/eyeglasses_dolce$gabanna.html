        <p>The best way to ensure you have purchased authentic Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses is to buy from an authorized
            retailer like FramesDirect.com. If you already have a pair of Dolce & Gabbana frames and can’t tell if
            they’re authentic, check the interior of the temples for the words "Made in Italy," the logo, and the CE
            symbol, which indicates European Conformity. If all of these elements are present and none of the logos or
            labels can be easily removed or scratched off, then your D&G frames are most likely real.</p>
