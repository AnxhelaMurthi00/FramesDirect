<h3>Harley-Davidson Eyeglass Frames Styles</h3>
<p>Harley-Davidson eyewear brings the proud tradition of an iconic American style sensibility to your prescription
    eyeglasses. Harley-Davidson crafts refined frames designed to express what drives you&#151;detailed accents
    embellish even the most sophisticated styles in this collection. Subtle tread patterns or studded details at the
    temple arms bring your enthusiasm for the open road to your everyday eyewear. Plastic and acetate frames come in
    versatile color combinations, while styles in stainless steel and memory metal stand up to an active lifestyle
    without complaint. A sleek, modern metal frame offers a contemporary style with gritty appeal, while cat-eye and
    aviator styles show off a subtle retro style. Classic rectangle frames in full-rim and semi-rimless styles offer a
    fashionable option that's ready for whatever activity you've planned.</p>
