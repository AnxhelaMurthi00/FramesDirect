        <p>The current trends in women’s eyeglasses skew towards bold, classic styles like browline and <a
                href="/collections/wayfarer-eyewear-dp" title="Wayfarer Eyewear">wayfarer frames</a>, and subtle,
            minimalist styles like rimless and semi-rimless frames. In fact, the two most popular styles of the year are
            a pair of rimless glasses from Silhouette and the timeless, <a href="/collections/browline-clubmaster-dp"
                title="Browline Clubmaster-style Frames">browline-style Clubmaster</a> from Ray-Ban. Not only are
            rimless and browline glasses currently in style, but even when they’re not at the top of the popularity
            podium, they’re usually in second or third place, which makes them a solid, long-term fashion investment.

        <p>Not only can a woman wear any pair of men’s eyeglasses that fit, women often choose to wear <a

                frames</a>. The only rule in eyewear is that your glasses should fit, and the only key difference
            between women’s and men’s glasses (besides colors and some shapes) is the frame size. So as long as the
            men’s frames fit comfortably, a woman can wear them with her own prescription.</p>
