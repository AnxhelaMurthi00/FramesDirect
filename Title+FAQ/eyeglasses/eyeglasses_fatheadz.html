    <dd class="accordion-content">
        <p>Rico Elmore, the owner and founder of Fatheadz Eyewear, started the company in 2004. The brand was born out
            of frustration over too-small eyeglasses that pinched, slipped, and left indentations at the nose or
            temples. Fatheadz Eyewear is dedicated to quality, style, and the belief that size shouldn't affect your
            comfort or accessibility to the refined frames you love wearing.</p>

        <p>You should always <a href="/knowledge-center/measure-your-frame-size">measure or be measured</a> before
            purchasing a pair of Fatheadz eyeglasses. Although the maker's goal is to create stylish eyeglasses in
            extended sizes, they're not just for big heads—Fatheadz ranks eyeglasses frames on a scale that includes
            regular, wide, wider, and widest styles. Frames at the top end of this scale are wider than six inches
            between hinge screws, so people with extra-large heads can find styles in a comfortable, flattering fit.</p>
