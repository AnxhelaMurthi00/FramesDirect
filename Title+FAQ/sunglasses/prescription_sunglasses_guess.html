    women who appreciate refined style with a nod towards more on-trend elements will find their new favorite pair here.

<p>Playful and provocative, fresh and fashion-forward&#151;the Rx sunglasses offered here suit a variety of tastes.
    Retro-inspired Guess cat-eye frames in a bold animal print are perfect for the wearer who embraces a classic
    Southern California aesthetic, while distinctive mixed-edge frames speak to more contemporary sensibilities. But
    these sunglasses are more than just fashionable: built for durability and comfort, our genuine Guess prescription
    sunglasses showcase exceptional quality. Guess crafts its Rx sunglasses of the finest materials, including
    corrosion-resistant Monel metal and lustrous acetate, a sturdy plant-based plastic, to create frames that are
    lightweight and wearable. Each pair of these sunglasses includes the brand's name or signature 'G' logo featured
    prominently on the temple, so you can be confident you're enjoying authentic Guess Rx sunglasses.</p>
<h3>Guess Prescription Sunglasses Lenses</h3>
<p>Guess uses only polycarbonate lenses in its prescription sunglasses; these lenses resist impact better than other
    types of lenses, and provide 100% UV protection. Offered in grey, green, or bronze, Guess sun lenses come with a
    variety of options, including an anti-reflective coating and polarization. Wearers looking for reduced glare and
    haze should choose polarized lenses, which allow for greater depth of vision and increased contrast. These Rx lenses
    are ideal for the beach, or a drive along the coast. Guess prescription sunglasses also come in styles with a
    gradient lens option. Gradient lenses&#151;darker at the top than at the bottom&#151;are preferred for driving, but
    are also the perfect lenses for outdoor reading.</p>
