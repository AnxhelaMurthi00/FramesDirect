    contemporary style meet in mixed-material frames. Traditional hues and finishes are the standard in this collection,
    but you’ll also find distinctive peach or vibrant blue frames. On-trend detailing adds sophistication to frames
    styles; discover crystal embellishments, diamond-shaped metal accents, sleek double bridges, and patterned hinges
    and temple arms.</p>

    in a variety of colors. Polarized lenses reduce haze and glare for crisp, clear vision; lenses with an
    anti-reflective coating reduce eye strain.</p>
