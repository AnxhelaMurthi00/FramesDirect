<h2>Gucci Prescription Sunglasses for Men &amp; Women</h2>

<p>The Gucci eyewear collection includes authentic prescription sunglasses in the same fearlessly bold styles that made
    the luxury brand a global favorite. Since the 1920s, the Gucci name has been synonymous with resplendent style, and
    the prescription sunglasses collection is no exception. Men's and women's sunglasses boast the unexpected design
    elements Gucci includes throughout its fashion lines, so your Rx eyewear is as glamorous as the styles you see on
    the runway.</p>

<h3>Gucci Rx Sunglasses Styles</h3>
<p>You'll find showy takes on classic <a href="/shop-by-shape/aviator-sunglasses-dp">aviators</a>, <a
        href="/collections/browline-clubmaster-dp">clubmasters</a>, and <a
        href="/shop-by-shape/cat-eye-eyewear-dp">cat-eye frames</a> in the Gucci prescription sunglasses collection.
    These oversized rounded frames, statement-making squares, and retro-cool silhouettes are all uniquely Gucci.
    Although it's known for over-the-top, daring styles in bright colors and flashy designs, Gucci prescription
    sunglasses also include a variety of understated frames and classic styles for refined tastes. Explore frames that
    suit your aesthetic, including styles with luxe accents, crystal embellishments, vivid color palettes, and metallic
    details. Gucci may be known for its larger-than-life image, but acetate and metal construction keeps the Rx
    sunglasses in this collection plenty lightweight and comfortable.</p>

<h3>Can You Put Prescription Lenses in Gucci Sunglasses?</h3>
<p>Yes! At FramesDirect.com, our staff of expert opticians is standing by to help you add prescription lenses to your
    favorite pair of Gucci shades. Additional options, including polarization and gradient tints, can customize your
    frames further. Polarized prescription lenses block harsh glare, so they're perfect for days spent by the water or
    driving. <a href-"/collections/gradient-lenses-dp">Gradient lenses</a> are darker at the top than they are at the
    bottom, so it's easier to see your dashboard or beach read. Look for specific features in each product listing, or
