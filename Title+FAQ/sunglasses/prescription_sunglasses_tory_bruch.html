<h2>Tory Burch Rx Sunglasses for Women</h2>
<p>Tory Burch prescription sunglasses elevate your style on sunny days while giving you the clarity you need for driving
    and all of your adventures at home and abroad. The Tory Burch Rx sunglasses collection for women captures the
    designer's refined, yet free-spirited aesthetic. The fashion maven opened her original store in the Manhattan's
    Nolita neighborhood in 2004, becoming a near-instant hit and expanding beyond clothing to other products, including
    eyewear.</p>

<p>Like her overall brand, Tory Burch prescription sunglasses frames are inspired by the vibrancy and color of New York
    City. The designer's eclectic influences beyond NYC include a preppy, American aesthetic, global bohemian style, as
    well as international film, photography, and art. The result is an Rx sunglasses frames collection that is vibrant
    and versatile.</p>
