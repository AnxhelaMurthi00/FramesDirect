<h2>Wiley X Prescription Sunglasses for Men and Women</h2>

<p>Wiley X prescription sunglasses and goggles deliver tough, durable, and effective protection from the sun and debris,
    for men and women in the line of duty, and for participants in extreme sports. Wiley X was founded in 1987 with a
    goal to provide quality ballistic eyewear for military personnel and law enforcement, as well as for civilians. The
    prescription sunglasses in the Wiley X collection include rigorously tested and ballistics-rated frames made for <a
        href="/shop-by-sport" title="Shop Frames by Sport">demanding activities</a>. Because FramesDirect uses rugged <a
        href="/knowledge-center/wiley-x-lenses">WX Lab Rx lenses</a> in each pair of Wiley X prescription sunglasses,
    these styles offer superior protection when you're sharpening your skills at an outdoor shooting or archery range,
    or for any active pursuit. Wiley X doesn't stop at performance: A variety of <a href="/shop-by-color"
        title="Shop Frames by Color">options in colors</a> and shapes allows the fashion-conscious man or woman to
    flaunt a bold, contemporary aesthetic in prescription sunglasses.</p>

<h3>Prescription Sunglasses Made to Wiley X Safety Standards</h3>
<p>Wiley X makes streamlined, Rx-ready sunglass frames and goggles to meet rigorous performance and safety standards.
    They're standard-issue prescription sunglasses for the FBI, DEA, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs Teams, and Military
    Special Forces. All Wiley X styles exceed OSHA standards and ANSI requirements, and a variety of frames also meet
    MIL-SPEC ballistic standards. The brand's Removable Facial Cavity<sup>&trade;</sup> Seals block dirt and debris,
    while non-slip materials grip tightly for a secure fit, making these prescription sunglasses go above and beyond
    standard eyewear.
