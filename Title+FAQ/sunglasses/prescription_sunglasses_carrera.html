<h2>Carrera Prescription Sunglasses for Men, Women & Children</h2>
<p>Carrera’s passion for innovation shows in this collection of prescription sunglasses that lives at the intersection
    of form and function. Wilhelm Anger named the company after the Carrera Panamericana&#151;widely considered the most
    dangerous race on the planet&#151;because he wanted his brand always to be on the edge, always pushing the
    boundaries of fashion and technology. First, that meant crafting ski racing goggles using patented Optyl, a material
    that was lighter, more durable and more adaptive to the wearer's face than anything the world had ever seen. He
    didn’t stop there, and a bold line of designer eyewear was born. Prescription lenses fine-tune these Rx-ready
    Carrera frames to your vision needs, in a style that perfectly suits your tastes.</p>
<h3>Carrera Prescription Sunglass Frames Styles</h3>
<p>Carrera’s collection of prescription sunglasses includes the iconic aviator, sleek rectangle frames, contemporary
    thick-rimmed rounds, and futuristic double-bridge styles. While some companies shy away from daring, it’s solidly
    inside Carrera’s comfort zone. Retro rounds and throwback aviators earn modern appeal with frames in sleek black,
    matte blue, crystal pink, and more. Frames made with stainless steel, memory metal, and Monel metal offer a clean
    look in a variety of silhouettes, large and small. A combination of metal and plastic lends a distinctive mixed
    media air to these fashion-forward frames.</p>
<h3>Prescription Lens Features and Tints</h3>
<p>Add lenses in your Rx to Carrera’s prescription-ready frames for crisp, clear vision and protection from the sun.
    Choose polarized lenses to block glare, ideal for days by the water or behind the wheel. Polarized lenses filter out
    the wavelengths of light that cause glare, resulting in a clearer, haze-free view. A number of lens colors are
    available; grey, green, and bronze lenses come polarized or non-polarized, and with or without an anti-reflective
    treatment. Create the ideal prescription sunglasses for your lifestyle with Carrera.</p>
<p>As an authorized retailer, FramesDirect sells only authentic Carrera prescription sunglasses, guaranteed.</p>
