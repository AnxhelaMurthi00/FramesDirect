<h3>Lens Options for Prescription Sunglasses</h3>
<p>Consider several lens options when buying your new prescription sunglasses. <a
        href="/collections/mirrored-sunglasses-dp" title=Mirrored Sunglasses">Mirror coating</a> is a reflective layer
    applied in varied densities to achieve the desired opacity; beyond its flashy style, mirror coating offers practical
    benefits: It decreases the amount of sunlight that reaches your eyes, reduces glare, and improves optical clarity.
</p>
<p>Sunglasses with <a href="/collections/best-polarized-sunglasses-dp" title="Shop Polarized Sunglasses">polarized
        lenses</a> realign horizontal light, which in turn reduces glare, improves contrast, and relieves eye strain. If
    you spend a lot of time outdoors or <a href="/collections/driving-sunglasses-dp" title="Driving Sunglasses">behind
        the wheel</a>, consider opting for polarized lenses in your prescription sunglasses.</p>
<p><a href="/collections/gradient-lenses-dp" title="Shop Gradient Lenses">Gradient lenses</a> in your prescription
    sunglasses feature a darker tint near the top of the rims that gradually lightens towards the bottom. Not only are
    they fashionable, but they offer improved vision in some scenarios, including driving, where the lighter lower
    portion of the lens allows you to see the dashboard clearly, and the darker tint at the top will filter the sunlight
    coming through the windshield.</p>

                desired prescription. Finally, we use chemical processes to add polarization if desired, to complete
