            surrounding skin area. Whether you are in the market for Maui Jim sunglasses with or without prescription

        <p>All Maui Jim prescription sunglasses feature PolarizedPlus2<sup>&reg;</sup> lenses to enhance contrast and
            allow for greater depth of vision, especially near water. While all Maui Jim prescription lenses are
            polarized in order to cut glare from bright, reflective surfaces like the ocean, the sports eyewear brand's
            Rx-ready frames also come in a selection of lens tints to suit the most common light conditions you
            encounter on land. <a href="/images/documents/maui-lens-colors.jpg">Maui Jim's prescription bronze, rose,
                and grey lens tints</a> are designed to enhance every adventure. The brand’s proprietary High
            Transmission (HT) lens tint is made for early mornings, late afternoons, or foggy days, when most other
            sunglasses would be too dark. No matter where your journey takes you, there’s a Maui Jim prescription
            sunglass lens to help you see better.</p>
