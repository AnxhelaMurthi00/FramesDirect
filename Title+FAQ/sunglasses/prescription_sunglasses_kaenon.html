    and contemporary silhouettes. Customized in your Rx, these sturdy sunglasses deliver superior optical clarity and
    engineering, made to withstand the active lifestyles of men and women who love the outdoors.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for vintage-inspired profiles, explore Kaenon’s take on classically cool aviators, distinctive
    cat-eyes, or the beloved wayfarer. Sleek rectangles and neo-futuristic wraparounds will speak to modern style
    sensibilities. Chunky squares, softer ovals, and rounded-edge shapes fill out the collection. Make a bold statement
    wearing bright colors or vibrant patterns, or opt for subdued conventional hues in frames that sport an understated

<p>These prescription sunglasses are designed for style, but will hold up to vigorous activities. Kaenon uses
    high-quality, lightweight and durable materials to create its frames, including TR-90, a flexible, injection-molded
    thermoplastic that holds its shape even when exposed to extreme temperatures. Metal frames come in Monel, a
    corrosion-resistant alloy that adjusts easily and retains its shape. Other plastic frames come in lustrous acetate,
    a versatile plant-based material that can be transformed into an array of brilliant colors and patterns.</p>
<h3>Kaenon Prescription Sunglass Lenses</h3>
<p>Kaenon prescription sunglass lenses are available in a number of customizable colors, tints, and prescriptions.
    Offered as single vision or progressives, lenses come in grey, copper, and yellow. Some polarized lenses come with
    mirror coating options to reduce glare and haze for exceptional visual clarity. Polarized lenses are ideal for days
    in bright sunlight, especially on or near the water. Authentic Kaenon prescription sunglasses promise exceptional
    optics and protection for your eyes, in timeless frames shapes you’ll love.</p>
