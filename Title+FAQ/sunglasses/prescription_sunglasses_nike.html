    excellence shows in these lightweight, impact-resistant frames with non-slip and venting features&#151;they won’t
    shatter, slide around, or fog up.</p>

<h3>Nike Prescription Sunglasses Lenses</h3>
<p>Polycarbonate lenses are the most common choice for active lifestyles, and they’re the standard in the Nike Rx
    sunglasses collection. This material is tested to withstand shock, and it’s UV-protective, making it ideal for
    outdoors enthusiasts, athletes, and kids. Anti-reflective and polarized lenses offer crisp, clear vision&#151;no
    glare or haze to impede your view. Gradient lenses, with a darker tint at the top of the lens and lighter at the
    bottom, are often preferred for driving, while mirrored lenses block still more sunlight on the brightest days.</p>
<h3>Nike Rx Sunglasses Frames</h3>
<p>Athletic styling abounds in much of the Nike sunglasses collection, but it also includes plenty of sporty takes on
    classic styles. Neutral frames are accented with vibrant colors to create sunglasses that brighten everyday looks.
    The trendy, contemporary frames are built to the same standards as the rest of the Nike eyewear collection, so you
    know you’re getting quality, whatever frames style you choose. Nike eyewear upholds the brand's reputation for
    unparalleled performance and on-trend styling by embracing technological innovation and state-of-the-art
    craftsmanship. Many of Nike’s strong, lightweight frames are made with rugged plastics that meet ANSI certification
    standards. Vented frames prevent fogging when you’re working up a sweat, and a secure fit ensures they’ll stay put.
    Carefully designed elements reflect Nike’s passion for quality products that speak to the brand’s prestige. This
    trusted go-to for athletes and fashion-savvy trendsetters combines style and performance in frames built to stand up
